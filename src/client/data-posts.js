        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Let's say I have 4 monitors with Xinerama (so 4 physical screens), and workspaces [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]. I am using XMonad.Layout.IndependentScreens, so each physical screen has its own set of workspaces (well, there are actually 12 total workspaces now, because each screen gets a copy of workspaces, like [\"1_a\", \"1_b\", \"1_c\", \"2_a\", \"2_b\" ... \"4_b\", \"4_c\"]). Let's imagine that each monitor is showing its workspace \"a\" (\"1_a\", \"2_a\", \"3_a\", \"4_a\"). What I want to do is make each screen show workspace \"b\", so that now we have \"1_b\", \"2_b\", \"3_b\", and\"4_b\" visible across the monitors.

        "description": "<h3 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h3><p>In the previous two installments of the <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/understanding-the-dom-document-object-model\">Understanding the DOM</a> series, we learned <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-access-elements-in-the-dom\">How To Access Elements in the DOM</a> and <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-traverse-the-dom\">How To Traverse the DOM</a>. Using this knowledge, a developer can use classes, tags, ids, and selectors to find any node in the DOM, and use parent, child, and sibling properties to find relative nodes.</p><p>The next step to becoming more fully proficient with the DOM is to learn how to add, change, replace, and remove nodes. A to-do list application is one practical example of a JavaScript program in which you would need to be able to create, modify, and remove elements in the DOM.</p><p>In this tutorial, we will go over how to create new nodes and insert them into the DOM, replace existing nodes, and remove nodes.</p><h2 id=\"creating-new-nodes\">Creating New Nodes</h2><p>In a static website, elements are added to the page by directly writing HTML in an <code>.html</code> file. In a dynamic web app, elements and text are often added with JavaScript. The <code>createElement()</code> and <code>createTextNode()</code> methods are used to create new nodes in the DOM.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Property/Method</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createElement\"><code>createElement()</code></a></td><td>Create a new element node</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createTextNode\"><code>createTextNode()</code></a></td><td>Create a new text node</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/textContent\"><code>node.textContent</code></a></td><td>Get or set the text content of an element node</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/innerHTML\"><code>node.innerHTML</code></a></td><td>Get or set the HTML content of an element</td></tr></tbody></table><p>To begin, let's create an <code>index.html</code> file and save it in a new project directory.</p><div class=\"code-label \" title=\"index.html\">index.html</div><pre class=\"code-pre HTML\"><code langs=\"\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html>\n&lt;html lang=\"en\">\n\n  &lt;head>\n    &lt;title>Learning the DOM&lt;/title>\n  &lt;/head>\n\n  &lt;body>\n    &lt;h1>Document Object Model&lt;/h1>\n  &lt;/body>\n\n&lt;/html>\n</code></pre><p>Right click anywhere on the page and select \"Inspect\" to open up Developer Tools, then navigate to the <strong><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-javascript-developer-console\">Console</a></strong>.</p><p>We will use <code>createElement()</code> on the <code>document</code> object to create a new <code>p</code> element.</p><pre class=\"code-pre custom_prefix\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"&gt;\">const paragraph = document.createElement('p');\n</li></ul></code></pre><p>We've created a new <code>p</code> element, which we can test out in the <em>Console</em>.</p><pre class=\"code-pre custom_prefix\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"&gt;\">console.log(paragraph)\n</li></ul></code></pre><pre class=\"code-pre \"><code langs=\"\"><div class=\"secondary-code-label \" title=\"Output\">Output</div>&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n</code></pre><p>The <code>paragraph</code> variable outputs an empty <code>p</code> element, which is not very useful without any text.

Therefore, it is recommended to use <code>textContent</code> instead, which will strip out HTML tags.<br/></span></p><p>It is also possible to create a text node with the <code>createTextNode()</code> method.</p><pre class=\"code-pre custom_prefix\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"&gt;\">const text = document.createTextNode(\"I'm a new text node.\");\n</li><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"&gt;\">console.log(text)\n</li></ul></code></pre><pre class=\"code-pre \"><code langs=\"\"><div class=\"secondary-code-label \" title=\"Output\">Output</div>\"I'm a new text node.\"\n</code></pre><p>With these methods, we've created new elements and text nodes, but they are not visible on the front end of a website until they've been inserted into the document.</p><h2 id=\"inserting-nodes-into-the-dom\">Inserting Nodes into the DOM</h2><p>In order to see the new text nodes and elements we create on the front end, we will need to insert them into the <code>document</code>. The methods <code>appendChild()</code> and <code>insertBefore()</code> are used to add items to the beginning, middle, or end of a parent element, and <code>replaceChild()</code> is used to replace an old node with a new node.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Property/Method</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/appendChild\"><code>node.appendChild()</code></a></td><td>Add a node as the last child of a parent element</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/insertBefore\"><code>node.insertBefore()</code></a></td><td>Insert a node into the parent element before a specified sibling node</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/replaceChild\"><code>node.replaceChild()</code></a></td><td>Replace an existing node with a new node</td></tr></tbody></table><p>To practice these methods, let's create a to-do list in HTML:</p><div class=\"code-label \" title=\"todo.html\">todo.html</div><pre class=\"code-pre \"><code class=\"code-highlight language-html\">&lt;ul>\n  &lt;li>Buy groceries&lt;/li>\n  &lt;li>Feed the cat&lt;/li>\n  &lt;li>Do laundry&lt;/li>\n&lt;/ul>\n</code></pre><p>When you load your page in the browser, it will look like this:</p><p><img src=\"https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/eng_javascript/dom/to-do-1.png\" alt=\"DOM Screenshot 1\"/></p><p>In order to add a new item to the end of the to-do list, we have to create the element and add text to it first, as we did in the \"Creating New Nodes\" section above.</p><pre class=\"code-pre custom_prefix\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"&gt;\">// To-do list ul element\n</li><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"&gt;\">const todoList = document.querySelector('ul');\n</li><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"&gt;\"></li><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"&gt;\">// Create new to-do\n</li><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"&gt;\">const newTodo = document.createElement('li');\n</li><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"&gt;\">newTodo.textContent = 'Do homework';\n</li></ul></code></pre><p>Now that we have a complete element for our new to-do, we can add it to the end of the list with <code>appendChild()</code>.</p><pre class=\"code-pre custom_prefix\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"&gt;\">// Add new todo to the end of the list\n</li><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"&gt;\">todoList.appendChild(newTodo);\n</li></ul></code></pre><p>You can see the new <code>li</code> element has been appended to the end of the <code>ul</code>.</p><div class=\"code-label \" title=\"todo.html\">todo.html</div><pre class=\"code-pre \"><code class=\"code-highlight language-html\">&lt;ul>\n  &lt;li>Buy groceries&lt;/li>\n  &lt;li>Feed the cat&lt;/li>\n  &lt;li>Do laundry&lt;/li>\n  &lt;li>Do homework&lt;/li>\n&lt;/ul>\n</code></pre><p><img src=\"https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/eng_javascript/dom/to-do-2.png\" alt=\"DOM Screenshot 2\"/></p><p>Maybe we have a higher priority task to do, and we want to add it to the beginning of the list. We'll have to create another element, as <code>createElement()</code> only creates one element and cannot be reused.</p><pre class=\"code-pre custom_prefix\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"&gt;\">// Create new to-do\n</li><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"&gt;\">const anotherTodo = document.createElement('li');\n</li><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"&gt;\">anotherTodo.textContent = 'Pay bills';\n</li></ul></code></pre><p>We can add it to the beginning of the list using <code>insertBefore()</code>. This method takes two arguments &mdash; the first is the new child node to be added, and the second is the sibling node that will immediately follow the new node. In other words, you're inserting the new node before the next sibling node. This will look similar to the following pseudocode:</p><pre class=\"code-pre \"><code class=\"code-highlight language-js\">parentNode.insertBefore(newNode, nextSibling);\n</code></pre><p>For our to-do list example, we'll add the new <code>anotherTodo</code> element before the first element child of the list, which is currently the <code>Buy groceries</code> list item.</p><pre class=\"code-pre custom_prefix\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"&gt;\">// Add new to-do to the beginning of the list\n</li><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"&gt;\">todoList.insertBefore(anotherTodo, todoList.firstElementChild);\n</li></ul></code></pre><div class=\"code-label \" title=\"todo.html\">todo.html</div><pre class=\"code-pre \"><code class=\"code-highlight language-html\">&lt;ul>\n  &lt;li>Pay bills&lt;/li>\n  &lt;li>Buy groceries&lt;/li>\n  &lt;li>Feed the cat&lt;/li>\n  &lt;li>Do laundry&lt;/li>\n  &lt;li>Do homework&lt;/li>\n&lt;/ul>\n</code></pre><p><img src=\"https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/eng_javascript/dom/to-do-3.png\" alt=\"DOM Screenshot 3\"/></p><p>The new node has successfully been added at the beginning of the list. Now we know how to add a node to a parent element. The next thing we may want to do is replace an existing node with a new node.</p><p>We'll modify an existing to-do to demonstrate how to replace a node. The first step of creating a new element remains the same.</p><pre class=\"code-pre custom_prefix\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"&gt;\">const modifiedTodo = document.createElement('li');\n</li><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"&gt;\">modifiedTodo.textContent = 'Feed the dog';\n</li></ul></code></pre><p>Like <code>insertBefore()</code>, <code>replaceChild()</code> takes two arguments &mdash; the new node, and the node to be replaced, as shown in the pseudocode below.</p><pre class=\"code-pre \"><code class=\"code-highlight language-js\">parentNode.replaceChild(newNode, oldNode);\n</code></pre><p>We will replace the third element child of the list with the modified to-do.</p><pre class=\"code-pre custom_prefix\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"&gt;\">// Replace existing to-do with modified to-do\n</li><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"&gt;\">todoList.replaceChild(modifiedTodo, todoList.children[2]);\n</li></ul></code></pre><div class=\"code-label \" title=\"todo.html\">todo.html</div><pre class=\"code-pre \"><code class=\"code-highlight language-html\">&lt;ul>\n  &lt;li>Pay bills&lt;/li>\n  &lt;li>Buy groceries&lt;/li>\n  &lt;li>Feed the dog&lt;/li>\n  &lt;li>Do laundry&lt;/li>\n  &lt;li>Do homework&lt;/li>\n&lt;/ul>\n</code></pre><p><img src=\"https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/eng_javascript/dom/to-do-4.png\" alt=\"DOM Screenshot 4\"/></p><p>With a combination of <code>appendChild()</code>, <code>insertBefore()</code>, and <code>replaceChild()</code>, you can insert nodes and elements anywhere in the DOM.</p><h2 id=\"removing-nodes-from-the-dom\">Removing Nodes from the DOM</h2><p>Now we know how to create elements, add them to the DOM, and modify existing elements. The final step is to learn to remove existing nodes from the DOM. Child nodes can be removed from a parent with <code>removeChild()</code>, and a node itself can be removed with <code>remove()</code>.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Method</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/removeChild\"><code>node.removeChild()</code></a></td><td>Remove child node</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ChildNode/remove\"><code>node.remove()</code></a></td><td>Remove node</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Using the to-do example above, we'll want to delete items after they've been completed. If you completed your homework, you can remove the <code>Do homework</code> item, which happens to be the last child of the list, with <code>removeChild()</code>.</p><pre class=\"code-pre custom_prefix\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"&gt;\">todoList.removeChild(todoList.lastElementChild);\n</li></ul></code></pre><div class=\"code-label \" title=\"todo.html\">todo.html</div><pre class=\"code-pre \"><code class=\"code-highlight language-html\">&lt;ul>\n  &lt;li>Pay bills&lt;/li>\n  &lt;li>Buy groceries&lt;/li>\n  &lt;li>Feed the dog&lt;/li>\n  &lt;li>Do laundry&lt;/li>\n&lt;/ul>\n</code></pre><p><img src=\"https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/eng_javascript/dom/to-do-5.png\" alt=\"DOM Screenshot 5\"/></p><p>Another method could be to remove the node itself, using the <code>remove()</code> method directly on the node.</p><pre class=\"code-pre custom_prefix\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"&gt;\">// Remove second element child from todoList\n</li><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"&gt;\">todoList.children[1].remove();\n</li></ul></code></pre><div class=\"code-label \" title=\"todo.html\">todo.html</div><pre class=\"code-pre \"><code class=\"code-highlight language-html\">&lt;ul>\n  &lt;li>Pay bills&lt;/li>\n  &lt;li>Feed the dog&lt;/li>\n  &lt;li>Do laundry&lt;/li>\n&lt;/ul>\n</code></pre><p><img src=\"https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/eng_javascript/dom/to-do-6.png\" alt=\"DOM Screenshot 6\"/></p><p>Between <code>removeChild()</code> and <code>remove()</code>, you can remove any node from the DOM. Another method you may see for removing child elements from the DOM is setting the <code>innerHTML</code> property of a parent element to an empty string (<code>\"\"</code>). This is not the preferred method because it is less explicit, but you might see it in existing code.</p><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>In this tutorial, we learned how to use JavaScript to create new nodes and elements and insert them into the DOM, and replace and remove existing nodes and elements.</p><p>At this point in the <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/understanding-the-dom-document-object-model\">Understanding the DOM series</a> you know how to access any element in the DOM, walk through any node in the DOM, and modify the DOM itself.

        "description": "<h3 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h3><p>Relying on a source code repository for versioning is a best practice that can get us back up and running when a code change causes our application to crash or to behave erratically. However, in case of a catastrophic event like a full branch getting accidentally deleted or losing access to a repository, we should leverage additional disaster recovery strategies.</p><p>Backing up our code repository into an object storage infrastructure provides us with an off-site copy of our data that we can recover when needed. <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/products/object-storage\">Spaces</a> is DigitalOcean's object storage solution that offers a destination for users to store backups of digital assets, documents, and code. </p><p>Compatible with the S3 API, Spaces allows us to use S3 tools like S3cmd to interface with it. <a href=\"http://s3tools.org/s3cmd\">S3cmd</a> is a client tool that we can use for uploading, retrieving, and managing data from object storage through the command line or through scripting.</p><p>In this tutorial we will demonstrate how to backup a remote Git repository into a DigitalOcean Space using S3cmd. To achieve this goal, we will install and configure Git, install S3cmd, and create scripts to backup the Git repository into our Space.</p><h2 id=\"prerequisites\">Prerequisites</h2><p>In order to work with Spaces, you'll need a DigitalOcean account. If you don't already have one, you can register on the <a href=\"https://cloud.digitalocean.com/registrations/new\">signup page</a>. </p><p>From there, you&rsquo;ll need to set up your DigitalOcean Space and create an API key, which you can achieve by following our tutorial <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-digitalocean-space-and-api-key\">How To Create a DigitalOcean Space and API Key</a>.</p><p>Once created, you&rsquo;ll need to keep the following details about your Space handy:</p><ul><li>Access Key</li><li>Secret Key (also called token)</li></ul><p>Additionally, you should have an Ubuntu 16.04 server set up with a sudo non-root user. You can get guidance for setting this up by following <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-16-04\">this Ubuntu 16.04 initial server setup tutorial</a>.</p><p>Once you have your Spaces information and server set up, proceed to the next section to install Git.</p><h2 id=\"install-git\">Install Git</h2><p>In this tutorial, we&rsquo;ll be working with a remote Git repository that we&rsquo;ll clone to our server. Ubuntu has Git installed and ready to use in its default repositories, but this version may be older than the most recent available release. </p><p>We can use the <code>apt</code> package management tools to update the local package index and to download and install the most recent available version of Git. </p><pre class=\"code-pre command\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">sudo apt-get update\n</li><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">sudo apt-get install git\n</li></ul></code></pre><p>For a more flexible way to install Git and to ensure that you have the latest release, you can consider <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-git-on-ubuntu-16-04#how-to-install-git-from-source\">installing Git from Source</a>.</p><p>We&rsquo;ll be backing up from a Git repository&rsquo;s URL, so we will not need to configure Git in this tutorial. For guidance on configuring Git, read this section on <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-git-on-ubuntu-16-04#how-to-set-up-git\">How To Set Up Git</a>. </p><p>Now we&rsquo;ll move on to cloning our remote Git repository. </p><h2 id=\"clone-a-remote-git-repository\">Clone a Remote Git Repository</h2><p>In order to clone our Git repository, we&rsquo;ll create a script to perform the task. Creating a script allows us to use variables and helps ensure that we do not make errors on the command line. </p><p>To write our executable script, we&rsquo;ll create a new shell script file called <code><span class=\"highlight\">cloneremote</span>.sh</code> with the text editor nano.</p><pre class=\"code-pre command\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">nano <span class=\"highlight\">cloneremote</span>.sh\n</li></ul></code></pre><p>Within this blank file, let&rsquo;s write the following script.</p><div class=\"code-label \" title=\"cloneremote.sh\">cloneremote.sh</div><pre class=\"code-pre \"><code langs=\"\">#!/bin/bash\n\nremoterepo=<span class=\"highlight\">your_remote_repository_url</span>\nlocalclonedir=<span class=\"highlight\">repos</span>\nclonefilename=<span class=\"highlight\">demoprojectlocal</span>.git\n\ngit clone --mirror $remoterepo $localclonedir/$clonefilename\n</code></pre><p>Let&rsquo;s walk through each element of this script. </p><p>The first line &mdash; <code>#!/bin/bash</code> &mdash; indicates that the script will be run by the Bash shell. From there, we define the variables that will be used in the command, which will run once we execute the script. These variables define the following pieces of configuration:</p><ul><li><code>remoterepo</code> is being assigned the remote Git repository URL that we will be backing up from</li><li><code>localclonedir</code> refers to the server directory or folder that we will be cloning the remote repository into, in this case we have called it <code><span class=\"highlight\">repos</span></code></li><li><code>clonefilename</code> refers to the filename we will provide to the local cloned repository, in this case we have called it <code><span class=\"highlight\">demoprojectlocal</span>.git</code></li></ul><p>Each of these variables are then called directly in the command at the end of the script.</p><p>The last line of the script uses the Git command line client beginning with the <code>git</code> command. From there, we are requesting to clone a repository with <code>clone</code>, and executing it as a mirror version of the repository with the <code>--mirror</code> tag. This means that the cloned repository will be exactly the same as the original one. The three variables that we defined above are called with <code>$</code>. </p><p>When you are satisfied that the script you have written is accurate, you can exit nano by typing the <code>CTRL</code> + <code>x</code> keys, and when prompted to save the file press <code>y</code>. </p><p>At this point we can run the shell script with the following command.</p><pre class=\"code-pre command\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">sh <span class=\"highlight\">cloneremote</span>.sh\n</li></ul></code></pre><p>Once you run the command, you&rsquo;ll receive output similar to the following.</p><pre class=\"code-pre \"><code langs=\"\"><div class=\"secondary-code-label \" title=\"Output\">Output</div>Cloning into bare repository './<span class=\"highlight\">repos</span>/<span class=\"highlight\">demoprojectlocal</span>.git'...\nremote: Counting objects: 3, done.\nremote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)\nReceiving objects: 100% (3/3), done.\nChecking connectivity... done.\n</code></pre><p>At this point, if you list the items in your current directory, you should see your backup directory there, and if you move into that directory you&rsquo;ll see the sub-folder with the filename that you provided in the script. That subdirectory is the clone of the Git repository. </p><p>With our remote Git repository cloned, we can now move on to installing S3cmd, which we can use to backup the repository into object storage. </p><h2 id=\"install-s3cmd\">Install S3cmd</h2><p>The S3cmd tool allows us to connect to the Spaces environment from the command line. We&rsquo;ll download the latest version of S3cmd from its <a href=\"https://github.com/s3tools/s3cmd\">public GitHub repository</a> and follow the recommended guidelines for installing it.</p><p>Before installing S3cmd, we need to install Python&rsquo;s Setuptools, as it will help with our installation (S3cmd is written in Python).</p><pre class=\"code-pre command\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">sudo apt-get install python-setuptools\n</li></ul></code></pre><p>Press <code>y</code> to continue.</p><p>With this downloaded, we can now download the S3cmd <code>tar.gz</code> file with <code>curl</code>.</p><pre class=\"code-pre command\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">cd /tmp\n</li><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">curl -LO https://github.com/s3tools/s3cmd/releases/download/<span class=\"highlight\">v2.0.1</span>/s3cmd-<span class=\"highlight\">2.0.1</span>.tar.gz\n</li></ul></code></pre><p>Note that we are downloading the file into our <code>tmp</code> directory. This a common practice when downloading files onto our server. </p><p>You can check to see if there is a newer version of S3cmd available by visiting the <a href=\"https://github.com/s3tools/s3cmd/releases\">Releases page</a> of the tool&rsquo;s GitHub repository. If you find a newer version, you can copy the <code>tar.gz</code> URL and substitute it into the <code>curl</code> command above.</p><p>When the download has completed, unzip and unpack the file using the tar utility:</p><pre class=\"code-pre command\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">cd ~\n</li><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">tar xf /tmp/s3cmd-*.tar.gz\n</li></ul></code></pre><p>In the commands above, we changed back to our home directory then executed the <code>tar</code> command. We used two flags with the command, the <code>x</code> indicates that we want to e<strong>x</strong>tract from a tar file and, and the <code>f</code> indicates that the immediately adjacent string will be the full path name of the file that we want to expand from. In the file path of the tar file, we also indicate that it is in the <code>tmp</code> directory.</p><p>Once the file is extracted, change into the resulting directory and install the software using sudo:</p><pre class=\"code-pre command\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">cd s3cmd-*\n</li><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">sudo python setup.py install\n</li></ul></code></pre><p>For the above command to run, we need to use <code>sudo</code>. The <code>python</code> command is a call to the Python interpreter to install the <code>setup.py</code> Python script.</p><p>Test the install by asking S3cmd for its version information:</p><pre class=\"code-pre command\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">s3cmd --version\n</li></ul></code></pre><pre class=\"code-pre \"><code langs=\"\"><div class=\"secondary-code-label \" title=\"Output\">Output</div>s3cmd version <span class=\"highlight\">2.0.1</span></code></pre><p>If you see similar output, S3cmd has been successfully installed. Next, we'll configure S3cmd to connect to our object storage service.</p><h2 id=\"configure-s3cmd\">Configure S3cmd</h2><p>S3cmd has an interactive configuration process that can create the configuration file we need to connect to our object storage server. During the configuration process, you will be asked for your Access Key and Secret Key, so have them readily available.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s start the configuration process by typing the following command:</p><pre class=\"code-pre command\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">s3cmd --configure\n</li></ul></code></pre><p>We are prompted to enter our keys, so let&rsquo;s paste them in and then accept <code>US</code> for the <strong>Default Region</strong>. It is worth noting that being able to modify the Default Region is relevant for the AWS infrastructure that the S3cmd tool was originally created to work with. Because DigitalOcean requires fewer pieces of information for configuration, this is not relevant so we accept the default. </p><pre class=\"code-pre \"><code langs=\"\">Enter new values or accept defaults in brackets with Enter.\nRefer to user manual for detailed description of all options.\nAccess key and Secret key are your identifiers for Amazon S3. Leave them empty for using the env variables.\nAccess Key []: <span class=\"highlight\">EXAMPLE7UQOTHDTF3GK4</span>\nSecret Key []: <span class=\"highlight\">b8e1ec97b97bff326955375c5example</span>\nDefault Region [US]:\n</code></pre><p>Next, we'll enter the DigitalOcean endpoint, <code>nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com</code>.</p><pre class=\"code-pre \"><code langs=\"\">Use \"s3.amazonaws.com\" for S3 Endpoint and not modify it to the target Amazon S3.\nS3 Endpoint [s3.amazonaws.com]: <span class=\"highlight\">nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com</span></code></pre><p>Because Spaces supports DNS-based buckets, at the next prompt we'll supply the bucket value in the required format:    </p><pre class=\"code-pre \"><code langs=\"\">%(bucket)s.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\n</code></pre><pre class=\"code-pre \"><code langs=\"\">Use \"%(bucket)s.s3.amazonaws.com\" to the target Amazon S3. \"%(bucket)s\" and \"%(location)s\" vars c\nan be used if the target S3 system supports dns based buckets.\nDNS-style bucket+hostname:port template for accessing a bucket []: <span class=\"highlight\">%(bucket)s.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com</span></code></pre><p>At this point, we're asked to supply an encryption password. We'll enter a password so it will be available in the event we want to use encryption.</p><pre class=\"code-pre \"><code langs=\"\">Encryption password is used to protect your files from reading\nby unauthorized persons while in transfer to S3\nEncryption password: <span class=\"highlight\">secure_password</span>\nPath to GPG program [/usr/bin/gpg]:\n</code></pre><p>We're next prompted to connect via HTTPS, but DigitalOcean Spaces does not support unencrypted transfer, so we'll press <code>ENTER</code> to accept the default, <code>Yes</code>.</p><pre class=\"code-pre \"><code langs=\"\">When using secure HTTPS protocol all communication with Amazon S3\nservers is protected from 3rd party eavesdropping. This method is\nslower than plain HTTP, and can only be proxied with Python 2.7 or newer\nUse HTTPS protocol [Yes]: \n</code></pre><p>Since we aren't using an HTTP Proxy server, we'll leave the next prompt blank and press <code>ENTER</code>.</p><pre class=\"code-pre \"><code langs=\"\">On some networks all internet access must go through a HTTP proxy.\nTry setting it here if you can't connect to S3 directly\nHTTP Proxy server name:\n</code></pre><p>After the prompt for the HTTP Proxy server name, the configuration script presents a summary of the values it will use, followed by the opportunity to test them. When the test completes successfully, enter <code>Y</code> to save the settings.</p><p>Once you save the configuration, you'll receive confirmation of its location.</p><p>When you have completed all the installation steps, you can double-check that your setup is correct by running the following command.</p><pre class=\"code-pre command\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">s3cmd ls\n</li></ul></code></pre><p>This command should output a list of Spaces that you have available under the credentials you provided.</p><pre class=\"code-pre \"><code langs=\"\"><div class=\"secondary-code-label \" title=\"Output\">Output</div>2017-12-15 02:52  s3://<span class=\"highlight\">demospace</span></code></pre><p>This confirms that we have successfully connected to our DigitalOcean Spaces. We can now move on to backing up our Git repository into object storage.</p><h2 id=\"backup-git-repository-into-object-storage\">Backup Git Repository into Object Storage</h2><p>With all of our tools installed and configured, we are now going to create a script that will zip the local repository and push it into our DigitalOcean Space.</p><p>From our home directory, let&rsquo;s call our script <code><span class=\"highlight\">movetospaces</span>.sh</code> and open it in nano.</p><pre class=\"code-pre command\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">cd ~\n</li><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">nano <span class=\"highlight\">movetospaces</span>.sh\n</li></ul></code></pre><p>We&rsquo;ll write our script as follows.</p><div class=\"code-label \" title=\"movetospaces.sh\">movetospaces.sh</div><pre class=\"code-pre \"><code langs=\"\">#!/bin/sh\n\ntar -zcvf <span class=\"highlight\">archivedemoproject</span>.tar.gz /<span class=\"highlight\">repos</span>/<span class=\"highlight\">demoprojectlocal</span>.git\n./s3cmd-<span class=\"highlight\">2.0.1</span>/s3cmd put <span class=\"highlight\">archivedemoproject</span>.tar.gz s3://<span class=\"highlight\">demospace</span></code></pre><p>Earlier in this tutorial, we&rsquo;ve used <code>tar</code> to unzip <code>s3cmd</code>, we are now using <code>tar</code> to zip the Git repository before sending it to Spaces. In the <code>tar</code> command, we specify four flags:</p><ul><li><code>z</code> compresses using the gzip method</li><li><code>c</code> creates a new file instead of using an existing one</li><li><code>v</code> indicates that we are being verbose about the files being included in the compressed file</li><li><code>f</code> names the resulting file with the name defined in the next string </li></ul><p>After the flags, we are providing a file name for the compressed file, in this case <code><span class=\"highlight\">archivedemoproject</span>.tar.gz</code>. We are also providing the name of the directory that we want to zip <code>/<span class=\"highlight\">repos</span>/<span class=\"highlight\">demoprojectlocal</span>.git</code>. </p><p>The script then executes <code>s3cmd put</code> to send <code><span class=\"highlight\">archivedemoproject</span>.tar.gz</code> to our destination Space <code>s3://<span class=\"highlight\">demospace</span></code>. </p><p>Among the commands you may commonly use with S3cmd, the <code>put</code> command sends files to Spaces. Other commands that may be useful include the <code>get</code> command to download files from the Space, and the <code>delete</code> command to delete files. You can obtain a list of all commands accepted by S3cmd by executing <code>s3cmd</code> with no options.</p><p>To copy your backup into your Space, we&rsquo;ll execute the script. </p><pre class=\"code-pre command\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">sh <span class=\"highlight\">movetospaces</span>.sh\n</li></ul></code></pre><p>You will see the following output:</p><pre class=\"code-pre \"><code langs=\"\"><div class=\"secondary-code-label \" title=\"Output\">Output</div><span class=\"highlight\">demoprojectlocal</span>.git/\n...\n<span class=\"highlight\">demoprojectlocal</span>.git/packed-refs\nupload: '<span class=\"highlight\">archivedemoproject</span>.tar.gz' -> 's3://<span class=\"highlight\">demobucket</span>/<span class=\"highlight\">archivedemoproject</span>.tar.gz'  [1 of 1]\n 6866 of 6866   100% in    0s    89.77 kB/s  done\n</code></pre><p>You can check that the process worked correctly by running the following command:</p><pre class=\"code-pre command\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">s3cmd ls s3://<span class=\"highlight\">demospace</span></li></ul></code></pre><p>You&rsquo;ll see the following output, indicating that the file is in your Space.</p><pre class=\"code-pre \"><code langs=\"\"><div class=\"secondary-code-label \" title=\"Output\">Output</div>2017-12-18 20:31      6866   s3://<span class=\"highlight\">demospace</span>/<span class=\"highlight\">archivedemoproject</span>.tar.gz\n</code></pre><p>We now have successfully backed up our Git repository into our DigitalOcean Space. </p><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>To ensure that code can be quickly recovered if needed, it is important to maintain backups. In this tutorial, we covered how to backup a remote Git repository into a DigitalOcean Space through using Git, the S3cmd client, and shell scripts. This is just one method of dozens of possible scenarios in which you can use Spaces to help with your disaster recovery and data consistency strategies.</p><p>You can learn more about what we can store in object storage by reading the following tutorials:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-logrotate-and-s3cmd-to-archive-logs-to-object-storage-on-ubuntu-16-04\">How To Use Logrotate and S3cmd to Archive Logs to Object Storage on Ubuntu 16.04</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-back-up-data-to-an-object-storage-service-with-the-restic-backup-client\">How To Back Up Data to an Object Storage Service with the Restic Backup Client</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-back-up-a-synology-nas-to-digitalocean-spaces\">How To Back Up a Synology NAS to DigitalOcean Spaces</a></li></ul>"

To be honest, I'm pretty compulsive obsessive about the whole thing. I can watch YouTube videos for hours studying how each works and why people like them. One question that I really wanted to tackle is \"Are there ways in which VS Code is actually better (i.e. more productive) than WebStorm, PyCharm, IntelliJ, etc.\" <br/><br/>I think this video <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6OhcGt5js4\">Moving from WebStorm to VSCode</a> does a pretty good job tackling this question, but I remain unconvinced. <br/><br/>I think there are three things I miss the most in VS Code compared to PyCharm, WebStorm, IntelliJ, etc.: <br/><br/>1. The Find window is much better in PyCharm. I can search for something in order to do a cross-project refactor. As I go through each entry, I don't lose my place in the find results, even if I have to edit the code for a few minutes. (Trying to do the same in VS Code is a fairly frustrating experience.) If I need to search for something else, I can save the results in a new tab without losing the original search. This is really important if the refactor takes me a few days, and I need to leave the results open the whole time. I can have a whole \"stack\" of completely different search results in different tabs. <br/><br/>2. The Git support in PyCharm is far more complete and advanced. The rebase flow is incredibly well done, especially when dealing with conflicts. <br/><br/>3. When I went to go rename a variable in Python in VS Code, it complained that I hadn't installed rope. It's well known that rope isn't nearly as good as what PyCharm has built in. My point is that VS Code works really well for TypeScript and JavaScript, but I think IntelliJ's \"infrastructure\" makes it better for a whole range of languages. An extension written by a third-party developer is no match for something done very well by the company itself at a foundational level. I'll admit that the guy who wrote the Python extension for VS Code just got hired by Microsoft, which is good, but I think my point still stands. <br/><br/>These arguments in favor of VS Code are not very persuasive to me: <br/><br/>1. I don't really care that it starts fast. So does Vi. I rarely restart PyCharm, so waiting, let's say, 15 seconds once a week or so is irrelevant when I consider all the time it saves me throughout the day. <br/><br/>2. I don't get excited by VS Code's themes. One good light theme and one good dark theme is really all that matters to me. Anything more is an invitation to yak shave :-P <br/><br/>3. I don't buy the fact that VS Code is an \"editor with a few features from an IDE\". It's an IDE. It has an editor, an integrated shell, integrated version control, an integrated debugger, integrated linting, etc. Calling it anything other than an IDE just doesn't make sense to me. Nor does saying that it's lightweight make sense since it's based on Electron which is itself based on millions of lines of C++. <br/><br/>4. Saying that it can do a lot of the things PyCharm does doesn't convince me that it's better than PyCharm. <br/><br/>5. It's a little frustrating to me that people are prejudiced against PyCharm because it's written in Java. VS Code runs on top of Electron (i.e. a browser engine). Java and JavaScript are both based on VMs written in C++. And here's the kicker: they were both written by a lot of the same people. V8 was written by a bunch of ex-Sun people working at Google :-P <br/><br/>At the end of the day, after very careful consideration, the only irrefutable arguments in favor of VS Code, in my mind, compared to PyCharm, WebStorm, IntelliJ, etc. are that: <br/><br/>1. It's free and open source. <br/><br/>2. It's hot right now. <br/><br/>So here are my thoughts: <br/><br/>1. Don't be afraid to learn new things. Don't let prejudices like \"it's an IDE\", \"it's written in Java\", \"it's written by Microsoft\", or \"it'll take longer than an hour to learn it\" hold you back. <br/><br/>2. If you work with a large team, there may be a benefit to using what other people around you are using, especially if they've set it up really nicely and committed the configuration to the repo. <br/><br/>3. In general, for very large codebases that you're getting paid to work on, there are a lot of benefits to using WebStorm, PyCharm, IntelliJ, etc. If you spend a fair amount of time doing very large refactors, the cost of PyCharm in terms of learning curve and money will be more than justified. <br/><br/>4. If you just want something to use for a small project or you want people at a workshop you're teaching to have something sensible, VS Code makes a lot of sense. <br/>"

        "description": "<p>As developers, we love to build parts of our application as modules, being that modules help to improve, especially the reusability of code. So, writing or importing modules into an existing or a new web application is almost inevitable. To make the workflow as seamless as possible we also make use of bundlers to compile file assets. &nbsp;</p><p><img data-src=\"https://cdn.scotch.io/13730/14UE0n0RZ65wSqaLpBUb_parcel-log.png\" alt=\"\"/><img/></p><p>Despite having numerous bundlers that carry out practically the same functionality but different and separate modes of configuration, I will like to present to you in this article, a new JavaScript bundler called <a href=\"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/scotch_io/~https://parceljs.org/\">Parcel</a>.</p><h2>What is Parcel and Why Use It?</h2><p>Parcel is an asset bundler for modern applications. It offers a blazing fast compilation time and zero configuration. Simply put, parcel allows simplicity in compiling file assets. Out of the box, parcel can be used on a large code base or just a very basic application that requires compilation of file assets. &nbsp;</p><p>According to the creator of Parcel, the intention was to solve two main problems with existing popular module bundlers like Browserify and Webpack: <strong>performance</strong> and <strong>hassles during configuration</strong>. With Parcel you can easily load modules with either commonJS and ES6 module syntax, as we will see later in this article.</p><p>With Over 12,000 stars already on Github. Parcel has surely gained a lot of attention from the community.</p><p>Some of the features include:</p><ul><li>Blazing fast bundling</li><li>Out of the box support for css, js, HTML, images, file assets and no need to install plugins to carry out all this</li><li>A built in development server.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Benchmark by Parcel</h3><p><img data-src=\"https://cdn.scotch.io/13730/67iS37uT3unKaBhwMiuL_image_preview.png\" alt=\"\"/><img/></p><h2>What we will learn</h2><p>In this article, I am going to show you how to set up parcel, how to create modules and how to use it with existing npm modules, sass and some other stuffs with very minimal or no configuration at all.\r\nReady? let&rsquo;s get to work!</p><h2>Getting Started</h2><p>Getting started and setting up Parcel is incredibly simple. Install Parcel globally on your machine with:&nbsp;</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npm install -g parcel-bundler</code></pre><p>If you are on unix, you might need to do this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">sudo npm install -g parcel-bundler</code></pre><p>Create a directory and intialize by creating a <code>package.json</code> file in the newly created project directory:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">mkdir parcel-project</code></pre><p>Now change directory and initialize a node project:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">cd parcel-project&nbsp;\r\nnpm init -y</code></pre><p>This will create a <code>package.json</code> with default settings within the project directory.</p><h2>Set Up Entry Point</h2><p>Parcel accepts files like HTML and JavaScript as an entry point. Create these files :</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">touch index.html &amp;&amp; touch index.js</code></pre><p>Add the relative path to your JavaScript file in the <code>index.html</code>.</p><pre><code class=\"language-html\">    &lt;!DOCTYPE html>\r\n    &lt;html lang=\"en\">\r\n    &lt;head>\r\n        &lt;meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\r\n        &lt;meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\r\n        &lt;meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"ie=edge\">\r\n        &lt;title>Parcel Project&lt;/title>\r\n    &lt;/head>\r\n    &lt;body>\r\n        &lt;h2 id=\"content\">&lt;/h2>\r\n        &lt;script src=\"./index.js\">&lt;/script>\r\n    &lt;/body>\r\n    &lt;/html></code></pre><p>Now open <code>Index.js</code> and write:</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">    console.log(\"This is just a test\");</code></pre><h2>Start Server</h2><p>Update <code>package.json</code>  file with a script to run parcel built in server.</p><pre><code class=\"language-json\">{\r\n...\r\n  \"scripts\": {\r\n    \"start\": \"parcel index.html\"\r\n  },\r\n ...\r\n}</code></pre><p>Start the server :</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npm run start</code></pre><p><img data-src=\"https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_40D14D86A2BF3EC77B50DB4E222C29503F83F1159982892681E9B7F10A814ECF_1513942166430_server.gif\" alt=\"\"/><img/></p><p><img data-src=\"https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_40D14D86A2BF3EC77B50DB4E222C29503F83F1159982892681E9B7F10A814ECF_1513942896513_Screen+Shot+2017-12-22+at+12.41.08+PM.png\" alt=\"\"/><img/></p><p>Apart from starting a local server on port 1234, Parcel will automatically create a <code>dist</code> folder</p><p><img data-src=\"https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_40D14D86A2BF3EC77B50DB4E222C29503F83F1159982892681E9B7F10A814ECF_1513943596108_Screen+Shot+2017-12-22+at+12.44.24+PM.png\" alt=\"\"/><img/></p><p>Within the new <code>dist``'</code> folder created, the new js file <code>parcel-project.js``'</code> contains the compiled code by parcel and also included is a new index.html file.</p><h2>Code Splitting</h2><p>To better demonstrate some other features of Parcel, lets import modules from a different files. Parcel supports both CommonJs and Es6 module syntax for importing files.</p><h2>CommonJS Syntax</h2><p>Create a new file:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">touch data.js</code></pre><p>Fill it with: </p><pre><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">// ./data.js \r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n    name: \"Olususi Oluyemi\",\r\n    designation: \"Software Developer\",\r\n    hobby: \"Writing\"\r\n}</code></pre><p>Next, require this module and access properties within it from <code>index.js</code> file:</p><pre><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">// ./index.js\r\nconst details = require('./data');\r\nvar content = \"My name is \" + details.name + \".\" + \" I am a \" + details.designation + \" and I love \" + details.hobby;\r\ndocument.getElementById('content').innerHTML = content;</code></pre><p>Here we required the module and write the content within it into the DOM. </p><p><img data-src=\"https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_40D14D86A2BF3EC77B50DB4E222C29503F83F1159982892681E9B7F10A814ECF_1513948308307_Screen+Shot+2017-12-22+at+2.10.20+PM.png\" alt=\"\"/><img/></p><h2>Es6 Module Syntax</h2><p>Lets do the same by using Es6 Module syntax. Change the content within <code>./data.js</code> to :</p><pre><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">export const details = {\r\n    name: \"Olususi Oluyemi\",\r\n    designation: \"Software Developer\",\r\n    hobby: \"Writing\" \r\n}</code></pre><p>In order to avoid undefined properties, change the mode of importing modules within <code>index.js</code> so that it can conform with Es6 Syntax.</p><pre><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">\r\n    // ./index.js\r\n    import { details } from './data';\r\n    var content = \"My name is \" + details.name + \".\" + \" I am a \" + details.designation + \" and I love \" + details.hobby;\r\n    document.getElementById('content').innerHTML = content;</code></pre><p>The result should still be the same.</p><h2>Hot Module Replacement</h2><p>For improved development experience, Parcel&rsquo;s hot module reloading implementation automatically updates modules in the browser without the need to refresh the page. This support is for both JavaScript and CSS assets. Lets try this out. Change the contents within <code>./data.js</code> and see the live update immediately your files are been saved :</p><p><img data-src=\"https://cdn.scotch.io/13730/rjeDx8RtT96V3L3XIcWA_hmr.gif\" alt=\"\"/><img/></p><h2>Transform</h2><p>Another awesome feature of Parcel is the support for common transforms and transpilers like Babel, PostCSS and PostHTML. Babel can be used to transform JavaScript, PostCSS for CSS and PostHTML for HTML. Each one of these transpilers has a unique configuration file and once Parcel finds anyone of the config files, it will automatically run these transforms.</p><h2>Working with Sass</h2><p>To work with Sass we will need to install <code>node-sass</code> package:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npm install node-sass</code></pre><p>Now create a sass file</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">    touch style.scss</code></pre><p>Add some styling and import  <code>style.scss</code> to <code>index.js</code>:</p><pre><code class=\"language-css\">// ./style.scss\r\nbody  {\r\n    color: red;\r\n    padding-right: 1rem;\r\n}</code></pre><p>Don&rsquo;t forget to import the style.css within index.js</p><pre><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">// .index.js\r\nimport './style.scss';\r\n// ...\r\n</code></pre><p><img data-src=\"https://cdn.scotch.io/13730/KeFiyxmqSjy0zSBM0b3M_Screen%20Shot%202017-12-23%20at%2012.19.45%20AM.png\" alt=\"\"/><img/></p><h2>Final Thought</h2><p>Parcel is still very new and certainly will have more features added by the creator subsequently. There is no better bundler than another, I strongly believe in choosing the right tool for the job. But if you love simplicity and ease of set up, you definitely want to try parcel.&nbsp;</p><p>As we have learnt from this article, setting up parcel is very simple and the support for all kind of files and other mind blowing features is incredibly encouraging. Feel free to try this out in your new or existing project.

        "description": "<h3 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h3><p>Understanding the state of your systems is essential for ensuring the reliability and stability of your applications and services.  Information about the health and performance of your deployments not only helps your team react to issues, it also gives them the security to make changes with confidence.  One of the best ways to gain this insight is with a robust monitoring system that gathers metrics, visualizes data, and alerts operators when things appear to be broken.</p><p>In our <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-metrics-monitoring-and-alerting\">introduction to metrics, monitoring, and alerting guide</a>, we discussed some of the core concepts involved in monitoring software and infrastructure.  Metrics are the primary material processed by monitoring systems to build a cohesive view of the systems being tracked.  Knowing which components are worth monitoring and what specific characteristics you should be looking at is the first step in designing a system that can provide reliable, actionable insights about the state of your software and hardware.</p><p>In this guide, we will start by discussing a popular framework used to identify the most critical metrics to track.  Afterwards, we will walk through how those indicators can be applied to components throughout your deployment.  This process will focus on the fundamental resources of individual servers at first and then adjust the scope to cover increasingly larger areas of concern.</p><h2 id=\"the-golden-signals-of-monitoring\">The Golden Signals of Monitoring</h2><p>In the highly influential <a href=\"https://landing.google.com/sre/book.html\">Google SRE (site reliability engineering) Book</a>, the chapter on monitoring distributed systems introduces a useful framework called the <strong>four golden signals of monitoring</strong> that represents the most important factors to measure in a user-facing system.  We will discuss each of these four characteristics below.</p><h3 id=\"latency\">Latency</h3><p>Latency is a measurement of the time it takes to complete an action.  The specifics of how this is measured depends on the component, but some common analogues are processing time, response time, or travel time.</p><p>Measuring latency gives you a concrete measure of how long a specific task or action takes to complete.  Capturing the latency of various components allows you to build a holistic model of the different performance characteristics of your system.  This can help you find bottlenecks, understand which resources require the most time to access, and notice when actions suddenly take longer than expected.  The authors of the SRE book emphasize the importance of distinguishing between successful and unsuccessful requests when calculating latencies, as they can have very different profiles that might skew the averages of a service.</p><h3 id=\"traffic\">Traffic</h3><p>Traffic measures the \"busyness\" of your components and systems.  This captures the load or demand on your services so that you can understand how much work your system is currently performing.</p><p>Sustained high or low traffic numbers can indicate that the service might need more resources or that a problem is preventing traffic from being routed correctly.  However, for the majority of cases, traffic rates will be most useful in helping understand issues surfaced through other signals.  For example, if latency increases beyond an acceptable level, being able to correlate that time frame with a spike in traffic is helpful.  Traffic can be used to understand the maximum amount of traffic that can be handled and how the service degrades or fails at various stages of load.</p><h3 id=\"errors\">Errors</h3><p>It is important to track errors to understand the health of your components and how frequently they are failing to respond to requests appropriately.  Some applications or services expose errors in clean, ready-made interfaces, but additional work may be required to gather the data from other programs.</p><p>Distinguishing between different types of errors can make it easier to pinpoint the exact nature of problems that are impacting your applications.  This also gives you flexibility in alerting.  You might need to be alerted immediately if one type of error appears, but for another, you might not be concerned as long as the rate is below an acceptable threshold.</p><h3 id=\"saturation\">Saturation</h3><p>Saturation measures how much of a given resource is being used.  Percentages or fractions are frequently used with resources that have a clear total capacity, but more creative measurements might be needed for resources with less well-defined maximum.</p><p>Saturation data provides information about the resources that a service or application depends on to operate effectively.  Since a service provided by one component may be consumed by another, saturation is one of the glue metrics that surfaces the capacity problems of underlying systems.  As such, saturation and latency problems in one layer might correspond with a marked increase in traffic or error measurements in the underlying layer.</p><h2 id=\"measuring-important-data-throughout-your-environment\">Measuring Important Data Throughout Your Environment</h2><p>Using the four golden signals as a guideline, you can begin to look at how those metrics would be expressed throughout the hierarchy of your systems.  Since services are often built by adding layers of abstraction on top of more basic components, metrics should be designed to add insight at each level of the deployment.</p><p>We will look at different levels of complexity present in common distributed application environments:</p><ul><li>Individual server components</li><li>Applications and services</li><li>Collections of servers</li><li>Environmental dependencies</li><li>End-to-end experience</li></ul><p>The ordering above expands the scope and level of abstraction with each subsequent layer.</p><h2 id=\"metrics-to-collect-for-individual-server-components\">Metrics to Collect for Individual Server Components</h2><p>The base level metrics that are important to collect are those relevant to the underlying computers that your systems rely on.  Although considerable effort in modern software development goes into abstracting the physical components and low level operating system details, every service relies on the underlying hardware and operating systems to do its work.  Because of this, keeping an eye on the foundational resources of your machines is the first step in building an understanding of the health of your systems.</p><p>When considering which metrics to collect at the machine level, think about the individual resources available.  These will include representations of your server's hardware as well as core abstractions provided by the OS, like processes and file descriptors.  Looking at each component in terms of the four golden signals, certain signals may be obvious while others may be more difficult to reason about.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.brendangregg.com\">Brendan Gregg</a>, an influential performance engineer, outlines many ways to get core metrics from Linux systems to satisfy the needs of a framework he calls the <a href=\"http://www.brendangregg.com/usemethod.html\">USE method for performance analysis</a> (<strong>u</strong>tilization, <strong>s</strong>aturation, and <strong>e</strong>rrors).  Since there is significant overlap between the USE method and the four golden signals, we can use some of his recommendations as a jumping off point for figuring out what data to collect from server components.</p><p>To measure <strong>CPU</strong>, the following measurements might be appropriate:</p><ul><li><strong>Latency</strong>: Average or maximum delay in CPU scheduler</li><li><strong>Traffic</strong>: CPU utilization</li><li><strong>Errors</strong>: Processor specific error events, faulted CPUs</li><li><strong>Saturation</strong>: Run queue length</li></ul><p>For <strong>memory</strong>, the signals might look like this:</p><ul><li><strong>Latency</strong>: (none - difficult to find a good method of measuring and not actionable)</li><li><strong>Traffic</strong>: Amount of memory being used</li><li><strong>Errors</strong>: Out of memory errors</li><li><strong>Saturation</strong>: OOM killer events, swap usage</li></ul><p>For <strong>storage devices</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Latency</strong>: average wait time (<code>await</code>) for reads and writes</li><li><strong>Traffic</strong>: read and write I/O levels</li><li><strong>Errors</strong>: filesystem errors, disk errors in <code>/sys/devices</code></li><li><strong>Saturation</strong>: I/O queue depth</li></ul><p>The <strong>networking</strong> signals can look like this:</p><ul><li><strong>Latency</strong>: Network driver queue</li><li><strong>Traffic</strong>: Incoming and outgoing bytes or packets per second</li><li><strong>Errors</strong>: Network device errors, dropped packets</li><li><strong>Saturation</strong>: overruns, dropped packets, retransmitted segments</li></ul><p>Along with representations of physical resources, it is also a good idea to gather metrics related to operating system abstractions that have limits enforced.  Some examples that fall into this category are file handles and thread counts.  These are not physical resources, but instead constructs with ceilings set by the operating system to prevent processes from overextending themselves.  Most can be adjusted and configured with commands like <code>ulimit</code>, but tracking changes in usage of these resources can help you detect potentially harmful changes in your software's usage.</p><h2 id=\"metrics-to-collect-for-applications-and-services\">Metrics to Collect for Applications and Services</h2><p>Moving up a layer, we start to deal with the applications and services that run on the servers.  These programs use the individual server components we dealt with earlier as resources to do work.  Metrics at this level help us understand the health of our single-host applications and services.  We've separated distributed, multi-host services into a separate section to clarify the factors most important in those configurations.</p><p>While the metrics in the last section detailed the capabilities and performance of individual components and the operating system, the metrics here will tell us how well applications are able to perform the work we ask of them.  We also want to know what resources our applications depend on and how well they manage those constraints.</p><p>It is important to keep in mind that the metrics in this section represent a departure from the generalized approach we were able to use last time.  The metrics that are most important from this point on will be very dependent on your applications' characteristics, your configuration, and the workloads that you are running on your machines.  We can discuss ways of identifying your most important metrics, but your results will depend on what the server is specifically being asked to do.</p><p>For applications that serve clients, the four golden signals are often fairly straightforward to pick out:</p><ul><li><strong>Latency</strong>: The time to complete requests</li><li><strong>Traffic</strong>: Number of requests per second served</li><li><strong>Errors</strong>: Application errors that occur when processing client requests or accessing resources</li><li><strong>Saturation</strong>: The percentage or amount of resources currently being used</li></ul><p>Some of the more important metrics you'll want to keep track of are those related to dependencies.  These will often be best expressed by saturation metrics related to individual components.  For instance, application memory utilization, available connections, number of file handles opened, or number of workers active can help you understand the effect of your configuration applied in the context of the physical server.</p><p>The four golden signals were designed primarily for distributed microservices, so they assume a client-server architecture.  For applications that do not use a client-server architecture, the same signals are still important, but the \"traffic\" signal might need to be reconsidered slightly.  This is basically a measurement of busyness, so finding a metric that adequately represents that for your application will serve the same purpose.  The specifics will depend on what your program is doing, but some general substitutes might be the number of operations or data processed per second.</p><h2 id=\"metrics-to-measure-collections-of-servers-and-their-communication\">Metrics to Measure Collections of Servers and Their Communication</h2><p>Most services, especially when operated in a production environment, will span multiple server instances to increase performance and availability.  This increased level of complexity adds additional surface area that is important to monitor.  Distributed computing and redundant systems can make your systems more flexible, but network-based coordination is more fragile than communication within a single host.  Robust monitoring can help alleviate some of the difficulties of dealing with a less reliable communication channel.</p><p>Beyond the network itself, for distributed services, the health and performance of the server group is more important than the same measures applied to any individual host.  While services are intimately tied to the computer they run on when confined to a single host, redundant multi-host services rely on the resources of multiple hosts while remaining decoupled from direct dependency on any one computer.</p><p>The golden signals at this level look very similar to those measuring service health in the last section.  They will, however, take into account the additional coordination required between group members:</p><ul><li><strong>Latency</strong>: Time for the pool to respond to requests, time to coordinate or synchronize with peers</li><li><strong>Traffic</strong>: Number of requests processed by the pool per second</li><li><strong>Errors</strong>: Application errors that occur when processing client requests, accessing resources, or reaching peers</li><li><strong>Saturation</strong>: The amount of resources currently being used, the number of servers currently operating at capacity, the number of servers available.</li></ul><p>While these have a definite resemblance to the important metrics for single-host services, each of the signals grows in complexity when distributed.  Latency becomes a more complicated issue as processing can require communication between multiple hosts.  Traffic is no longer a function of a single server's abilities, but is instead a summary of the groups capabilities and the efficiency of the routing algorithm used to distribute work.  Additional error modes are introduced related to networking connectivity or host failure.  Finally, saturation expands to include the combined resources available to the hosts, the networking link connecting each host, and the ability to properly coordinate access to the dependencies each computer needs.</p><h2 id=\"metrics-related-to-external-dependencies-and-the-deployment-environment\">Metrics Related to External Dependencies and the Deployment Environment</h2><p>Some of the most valuable metrics to collect exist at the boundary of your application or service, outside of your direct control.  External dependencies including those related to your hosting provider and any services your applications are built to rely on.  These represent resources you are not able to administer directly, but which can compromise your ability to guarantee your own service.</p><p>Because external dependencies represent critical resources, one of the only mitigation strategies available in case of full outages is to switch operations to a different provider.  This is only a viable strategy for commodity services, and even then only with prior planning and loose coupling with the provider.  Even when mitigation is difficult, knowledge of external events affecting your application is incredibly valuable.</p><p>The golden signals applied to external dependencies may look similar to this:</p><ul><li><strong>Latency</strong>: Time it takes to receive a response from the service or to provision new resources from a provider</li><li><strong>Traffic</strong>: Amount of work being pushed to an external service, the number of requests being made to an external API</li><li><strong>Errors</strong>: Error rates for service requests</li><li><strong>Saturation</strong>: Amount of account-restricted resources used (instances, API requests, acceptable cost, etc.)</li></ul><p>These metrics can help you identify problems with your dependencies, alert you to impending resource exhaustion, and help keep expenses under control.  If the service has drop-in alternatives, this data can be used to decide whether to move work to a different provider when metrics indicate a problem is occurring.  For situations with less flexibility, the metrics can at least be used to alert an operator to respond to the situation and implement any available manual mitigation options.</p><h2 id=\"metrics-that-track-overall-functionality-and-end-to-end-experience\">Metrics that Track Overall Functionality and End-to-End Experience</h2><p>The highest level metrics track requests through the system in context of the outermost component that users interact with.  This might be a load balancer or other routing mechanism that is responsible for receiving and coordinating requests to your service.  Since this represents the first touch point with your system, collecting metrics at this level gives an approximation of the overall user experience.</p><p>While the previously described metrics are incredibly useful, the metrics in this section are often the most important to set up alerting for.  To avoid response fatigue, alerts&mdash;especially pages&mdash;should be reserved for scenarios that have a recognizable negative effect on user experience.  Problems surfaced with these metrics can be investigated by drilling down using the metrics collected at other levels.</p><p>The signals we look for here are similar to those of the individual services we described earlier.  The primary difference is the scope and the importance of the data we gather here:</p><ul><li><strong>Latency</strong>: The time to complete user requests </li><li><strong>Traffic</strong>: Number of user requests per second</li><li><strong>Errors</strong>: Errors that occur when processing client requests or accessing resources</li><li><strong>Saturation</strong>: The percentage or amount of resources currently being used</li></ul><p>As these metrics parallel user requests, values that fall outside of acceptable ranges for these metrics likely indicate direct user impact.  Latency that does not conform to customer-facing or internal SLAs (service level agreements), traffic that indicates a severe spike or drop off, increases in errors rates, and an inability to serve requests due to resource constraints are all fairly straightforward to reason about at this level.  Assuming that the metrics are accurate, the values here can be directly mapped against your availability, performance, and reliability goals.</p><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>In this guide, we began by discussing the four golden signals that tend to be most helpful for discovering and understanding impactful changes in your systems.  Afterwards, we used the signals as a lens to evaluate the most important factors to track at different layers of a deployment.</p><p>Evaluating your systems from from top to bottom can help identify the critical components and interactions required to run reliable and performant services.  The four golden signals can be a great starting point for structuring metrics to best indicate the health of your systems.  However, keep in mind that while the golden signals are a good framework, you will have to be aware of other metrics specific to your situation.  Collect whatever data you think will be most likely to warn of problems or help you troubleshoot when things go wrong.</p>"

However, <code>ghc-mod</code> seems to have problems when compiled with GHC 8.2 as of now (which has something to do with it's feature <em>backpack</em>, see <a href=\"https://github.com/DanielG/ghc-mod/issues/900#issuecomment-335448771\">this comment</a> in a GitHub pull request).

This seems\nparticularly true for New Yorkers as our income seems higher than that\nof people from other parts of the country but our cost of living is\nhigher as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMy wife and I are both career public educators. No one would confuse a\nfamily of two working teachers as upper class but we were granted no\nfinancial aid for our kids. The alternatives without a great public\noption are to have saved for our entire lives and now liquidate those\nsavings or go into tremendous debt.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThis alone makes the mission critical. Add to that the accessibility\nissue - elite private institutions only have to concern themselves\nwith whatever slice of the population they choose to accept. We are\ncharged with providing a top flight education to all - be they the\nhigh achievers, the late bloomers, the struggling students or anyone \nelse.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSo, what's happened in the past year?\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFirst, the Daedalus honors program is developing nicely. In our first\nyear we had a cohort of 12. This past year 27. I haven't seen the\napplicant pool yet - Hunter applications are open until the end of\nJanuary, but I'm hoping to bring in an even larger cohort this year. I\nspent a good amount of time this fall visiting high schools to talk\nabout Hunter CS and CS options in general. Not as many as I'd like but\nmore than during year one. \n</p>\n\n<p>\nWe had classes, trips, and special events but more important was that\nthe cohort is starting to form a community and the students want it to\nbe a community that includes ALL of Hunter CS, not just the honors\nstudents.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey've started a once a week Dojo where students can work on projects\nand interact and we're starting an evening speaker series in\nthe Spring. \n</p>\n\n<p>\nOverall there's a vibe of excitement and an energy around Hunter CS\nthat I've been told hasn't been there before.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn my class, I've been introducing a number of real world practices\nthat are usually not covered in undergraduate CS and we're starting to\ntalk about bringing those practices into the non-honors sections.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFinally, we've started to partner with the New York Tech\ncommunity. We're bringing together the Hunter students and the tech\nprofessionals to raise awareness outside of Hunter of what our\nstudents can do and to best prepare our students for their next\nsteps. These partnerships, in addition to internship possibilities\nhave led to us planning some great things this coming semester\nincuding:\n</p>\n<ul class=\"org-ul\">\n<li>workshops such as how to work on an open source project or how to do\na code review.</li>\n<li>Having industry mentors at our local Dojo sessions.</li>\n<li>Mixer events to educate our students as to the variety of pathways\nthey can follow when they graduate.</li>\n<li>and more.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\nThis past year set the stage but there will be some challenges moving\nforward.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe biggest one is continued outreach to high schools. Getting to the\nstudents and their parents to let them know that we have a great\nprogram. It's also about convincing them to come to Hunter. Back in\nthe day CUNY was \"the poor man's Harvard\" but open enrollment in the\n1970s killed that reputation. CUNY has been making it's way back and\nHunter has many excellent programs but reputations are decades in the\nmaking and at Hunter CS we're just starting to get the word out.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe other big challenge will be with time. Right now, for the most\npart, I'm a team of one. I have tremendous support from my colleagues\nbut they all have their own full time obligations and the overall\ngrowth in Hunter CS has already put a strain on personnel and\nresources.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn spite of the challenges, I'm not complaining. This has been an\nexciting year for Hunter CS and an exciting year for me to be a part\nof it.\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

        "description": "<div id=\"outline-container-org80491be\" class=\"outline-2\"><h2 id=\"org80491be\"></h2><div class=\"outline-text-2\" id=\"text-org80491be\"><p>\nI usually don't do year in review posts. At Stuy, not much changed\nyear after year so I never felt it worth summarizing the past and\nprojecting the future. At Hunter, now that I'm a couple of years in,\nprojects are really picking up steam so I think it's worth talking\nabout them.\n</p><p>\nOne of my two major missions at Hunter was to build a CS Honors\nprogram and raise the profile of Hunter's undergraduate CS program in\ngeneral. Hunter had a strong CS program before I joined the team it's\njust that few people knew about it.\n</p><p>\nMy goal is to see Hunter become the \"go to\" institution for\nundergraduate CS in New York City before my time is done.\n</p><p>\nThis is an extremely important mission. \n</p><p>\nThere are other strong CS options besides Hunter but compare the costs:\n</p><table border=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" rules=\"groups\" frame=\"hsides\"><colgroup><col class=\"org-left\"/><col class=\"org-left\"/><col class=\"org-left\"/><col class=\"org-left\"/><col class=\"org-left\"/><col class=\"org-left\"/><col class=\"org-left\"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\" class=\"org-left\">Institution</th><th scope=\"col\" class=\"org-left\">&nbsp;</th><th scope=\"col\" class=\"org-left\">&nbsp;</th><th scope=\"col\" class=\"org-left\">&nbsp;</th><th scope=\"col\" class=\"org-left\">&nbsp;</th><th scope=\"col\" class=\"org-left\">&nbsp;</th><th scope=\"col\" class=\"org-left\">Annual Tuition</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"org-left\">NYU</td><td class=\"org-left\">&nbsp;</td><td class=\"org-left\">&nbsp;</td><td class=\"org-left\">&nbsp;</td><td class=\"org-left\">&nbsp;</td><td class=\"org-left\">&nbsp;</td><td class=\"org-left\">$50,464</td></tr><tr><td class=\"org-left\">NYY Tandon</td><td class=\"org-left\">&nbsp;</td><td class=\"org-left\">&nbsp;</td><td class=\"org-left\">&nbsp;</td><td class=\"org-left\">&nbsp;</td><td class=\"org-left\">&nbsp;</td><td class=\"org-left\">$48,750</td></tr><tr><td class=\"org-left\">Columbia</td><td class=\"org-left\">&nbsp;</td><td class=\"org-left\">&nbsp;</td><td class=\"org-left\">&nbsp;</td><td class=\"org-left\">&nbsp;</td><td class=\"org-left\">&nbsp;</td><td class=\"org-left\">$54,504</td></tr></tbody><tbody><tr><td class=\"org-left\">Hunter</td><td class=\"org-left\">&nbsp;</td><td class=\"org-left\">&nbsp;</td><td class=\"org-left\">&nbsp;</td><td class=\"org-left\">&nbsp;</td><td class=\"org-left\">&nbsp;</td><td class=\"org-left\">$6,530</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div id=\"outline-container-org579e945\" class=\"outline-2\"><h2 id=\"org579e945\"></h2><div class=\"outline-text-2\" id=\"text-org579e945\"><p><b><b>Hunter is about one tenth the cost.</b></b></p><p>\nTrue, if you're wealthy this isn't a problem and if you're at the\nbottom of the economic ladder you might get a full ride but if you\nfall into that category where you earn more than the financial aid\npeople think is \"poor\" but are clearly not rich you're left in a bad place. This seems\nparticularly true for New Yorkers as our income seems higher than that\nof people from other parts of the country but our cost of living is\nhigher as well.\n</p><p>\nMy wife and I are both career public educators. No one would confuse a\nfamily of two working teachers as upper class but we were granted no\nfinancial aid for our kids. The alternatives without a great public\noption are to have saved for our entire lives and now liquidate those\nsavings or go into tremendous debt.\n</p><p>\nThis alone makes the mission critical. Add to that the accessibility\nissue - elite private institutions only have to concern themselves\nwith whatever slice of the population they choose to accept. We are\ncharged with providing a top flight education to all - be they the\nhigh achievers, the late bloomers, the struggling students or anyone \nelse.\n</p><p>\nSo, what's happened in the past year?\n</p><p>\nFirst, the Daedalus honors program is developing nicely. In our first\nyear we had a cohort of 12. This past year 27. I haven't seen the\napplicant pool yet - Hunter applications are open until the end of\nJanuary, but I'm hoping to bring in an even larger cohort this year. I\nspent a good amount of time this fall visiting high schools to talk\nabout Hunter CS and CS options in general. Not as many as I'd like but\nmore than during year one. \n</p><p>\nWe had classes, trips, and special events but more important was that\nthe cohort is starting to form a community and the students want it to\nbe a community that includes ALL of Hunter CS, not just the honors\nstudents.\n</p><p>\nThey've started a once a week Dojo where students can work on projects\nand interact and we're starting an evening speaker series in\nthe Spring. \n</p><p>\nOverall there's a vibe of excitement and an energy around Hunter CS\nthat I've been told hasn't been there before.\n</p><p>\nIn my class, I've been introducing a number of real world practices\nthat are usually not covered in undergraduate CS and we're starting to\ntalk about bringing those practices into the non-honors sections.\n</p><p>\nFinally, we've started to partner with the New York Tech\ncommunity. We're bringing together the Hunter students and the tech\nprofessionals to raise awareness outside of Hunter of what our\nstudents can do and to best prepare our students for their next\nsteps. These partnerships, in addition to internship possibilities\nhave led to us planning some great things this coming semester\nincuding:\n</p><ul class=\"org-ul\"><li>workshops such as how to work on an open source project or how to do\na code review.</li><li>Having industry mentors at our local Dojo sessions.</li><li>Mixer events to educate our students as to the variety of pathways\nthey can follow when they graduate.</li><li>and more.</li></ul><p>\nThis past year set the stage but there will be some challenges moving\nforward.\n</p><p>\nThe biggest one is continued outreach to high schools. Getting to the\nstudents and their parents to let them know that we have a great\nprogram. It's also about convincing them to come to Hunter. Back in\nthe day CUNY was \"the poor man's Harvard\" but open enrollment in the\n1970s killed that reputation. CUNY has been making it's way back and\nHunter has many excellent programs but reputations are decades in the\nmaking and at Hunter CS we're just starting to get the word out.\n</p><p>\nThe other big challenge will be with time. Right now, for the most\npart, I'm a team of one. I have tremendous support from my colleagues\nbut they all have their own full time obligations and the overall\ngrowth in Hunter CS has already put a strain on personnel and\nresources.\n</p><p>\nIn spite of the challenges, I'm not complaining. This has been an\nexciting year for Hunter CS and an exciting year for me to be a part\nof it.\n</p></div></div>"

The new structure will be comprised of individuals from Apple, Google, Microsoft and Mozilla. The Big Four, you might say.</p><p>I find this interesting because we often think of the Web as a wild west where standards are always evolving and adopted at a different pace. This change largely keeps public contributions to the Living Standards in tact, but establishes a clearer line of communication between working groups and provides a path to appeal and resolve disputes over standards. </p><blockquote><p>Living Standards are informed by input from contributors, driven by workstream participants, articulated by editors, and coordinated by the Steering Group. If necessary, controversies are resolved by the Steering Group with members appointed from the organizations that develop browser engines.</p></blockquote><p>And, with representatives from leading browsers at the table, we may see more agreement with adoption. I'm speculating here, but it seems reasonable.</p><p>If you're like me and are fuzzy on the differences between WHATWG and W3C, Bruce Lawson has a pretty <a href=\"http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/2017/editing-the-w3c-html5-spec/\">simple explanation</a>. It still kinda blows my mind that they're both standards we often refer to but come from two completely different groups.</p><p><a href=\"https://blog.whatwg.org/working-mode-changes\" title=\"Direct link to featured article\">Direct Link to Article</a> &mdash; <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/working-mode-changes-whatwg/\">Permalink</a></p><hr/><hr/><p><small><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://css-tricks.com/working-mode-changes-whatwg/\">Further working mode changes at WHATWG</a> is a post from <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://css-tricks.com\">CSS-Tricks</a></small></p>"

        "title": "Joining eyeo: A Year in Review",
        "description": "It's been well over a year since I&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blog.tfnico.com/2017/01/joining-eyeo.html\">joined eyeo</a>. And 'tis the season for yearly reviews, so...<br/><br/>It's been pretty wild. So many times I thought \"this stuff really deserves a bloggin\", but then it was too inviting to grab onto the next thing and get that rolling.<br/><br/>Instead of taking a deep dive into some topic already, I want to scan through that year in review and think for myself, what were the big things, the important things, the things I achieved, and the things I learned. And then later on, if I ever get around to it, grab one of these topics and elaborate in a dedicated blog-post. Like a bucket-list of the blog posts that I should have written. Here goes:<br/><h3>How given no other structures, silos will grow by themselves</h3>This was my initial shock after joining the company. Only a few years after taking off as a startup, the hedges began growing, seemingly almost by themselves, and against the will of the founders. I've worked in silos, and in companies without them, but I haven't been there to witness them coming into existence before. It is a fascinating phenomenon, yet oh, so common. And a killer of great companies.<br/><h3>When you got no other reason for improving, go for lead time</h3>There are so many reasons for why you would want to drive organizational change, stop the silofication, bring in some agile values, and so on. But the one reason that rings true and clear for any person in the company is&nbsp;<i>lead time</i>. Then you can slowly start to talk about the cost of WIP, hand-offs, and so on.&nbsp;&nbsp;When explaining the why, start with lead time.<br/><h3>The best patterns for introducing organizational change in are inscrutable</h3>I tried out several patterns, from early adopters, to whispering in the general's ear. I tried driving changes by committee and without. We tried bootstrapping, and we tried organic change. It always felt like a mix of hurt and help, but it seems through any of the changes, they were for the better (unless they are driven by targets, of course). The only way to know for sure whether I had the right strategy is to go back in time and compare how the options would work out in alternative realities. So we're left with, once again, gut feelings.<br/><h3>Developing the ubiquitous language of organizational change</h3>In a company where the norm is to shun any hype, and avoiding cargo-culting by all means, it was not easy to use the language I had come to learn in the industry. Mentioning Agile would derail any discussion into shoot-downs, anecdotes and personal opinions and experiences. Few of the agile values, principles or practices were taken at face value. The more experienced colleagues had bad experiences with \"agile transformations\", and the large majority of younger colleagues (funny, cause I feel like I've always been the youngest where ever I worked, and suddenly here I'm in the oldest 15 percentile) have not suffered the pains of silofication, nor experienced the joy of successful organizational change.<br/><br/>As is the norm these days, \"DevOps\" has already been reduced to infrastructure engineering. Scrum is a fad, Kanban is a board on the wall, XP is some long gone neck-beard hippie thing. Sprints are pointless. Conway's law is unknown, as is Lean. Rationality, skepticism and pragmatism rules. Which can be good, but it can also grind conversations about organizational improvement to zero velocity (pun intended).<br/><br/>So, I started with a survey, \"What should we call the things\". By now, we've basically come up with our own methodology. Hell, it's even one of them \"scaling\" ones. And we use a lot of seemingly boring words to describe very powerful things.<br/><h3>The emerging trend of self-management in organizations is going to be big</h3><div>As eyeo is at the steps of exploiting more agile values and principles, we also look to the horizon to see what is coming. The ideas of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.reinventingorganizationswiki.com/Teal_Organizations\">teal organizations</a>&nbsp;rhyme very well with agile and DevOps, but they go way beyond. Surprisingly (and yet, perhaps not), a lot of these self-organizing principles are easier to apply to eyeo than the agile predecessors. Albeit eyeo is an overgrown start-up of sorts, with the expected chaos, their universal inner values are&nbsp;<b>fairness</b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<b>transparency</b>. Armed with this, a lot of the self-organizing patterns are a great fit.</div><h3>Balancing the act of dropping into Operations, while driving organizational change</h3><div>This is where I failed the hardest. And perhaps where I learned the most. How can I reconcile the act of supporting one particular department, while I at the same time am trying to break them up across cross-functional teams? I went on for too long ignoring this conflict, and it cost a lot of soul to make things right, and there's still a lot to do.</div><h3>Building bridges in a company which is both remote and not</h3><div>I am a hybrid remote worker, which means I am simply not a remote worker (or remotee, as they're called at eyeo). As most remote workers know, a mixed remote/local team is the trickiest constellation to have in any company. It does work at eyeo so far, mostly for historical reasons and remote culture being deep in the DNA of the founders, but it will only get us so far. We can't become co-located, nor does the majority really want to, so we have to improve. I've got some ideas, but haven't gotten so far with this yet.</div><h3>Team autonomy vs company standardization</h3><div>This one's a real classic. How can you pick a company-standard chat tool, while giving teams the autonomy to pick their own? This topic is fairly exhausted in the DevOps literature by now, I guess, so I'm not sure it's worth it. I got a lot of thoughts on it, but they may not be so original. A lot of it comes down to&nbsp;<b>decision making</b>, which in its own right is a big topic.</div><h3>It's like blog post tapas</h3><div>So, those are the ones I had in my head right now. If you got this far, and you'd care to give me a tweet, let me know which one I should write first.</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/tfnico/~4/iIhBKbzHaqs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/><img/>"

Factory Method is about creating one type of object, and Abstract Factory is about creating a family of different types of objects. All three of them are about encapsulating object creation by using the design principle: encapsulate what varies.</p><h3 name=\"2fb5\" id=\"2fb5\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Benefits of using Simple&nbsp;Factory</h3><p name=\"973d\" id=\"973d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Pulling the logic of creating the correct cheesecake based on a given type is a small move that gives us lots of benefits. The biggest benefit is that we can modify the cheesecake list without touching the <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">make_cheesecake</code> method and its test. All we need to do is update the <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">CheesecakeFactory</code> class and leave <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">make_cheesecake</code><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\"></em>and its test alone.</p><p name=\"4aa2\" id=\"4aa2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">We want to separate the parts that vary often from the stable parts. Because each time we modify a part of our code, we might introduce bugs. The parts that vary are the fragile parts of our system. We want to keep the stable parts away from the fragile parts.

        "summary": "<blockquote>As this is a holiday week, per our usual tradition, we&#39;re revisiting some of the most popular articles from the year. We start with <a href=\"/articles/the-second-factor\">The Second Factor</a>, a tale of security gone wrong. -- Remy</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Famed placeholder company Initech is named for its hometown, Initown. Initech recruits heavily from their hometown school, the University of Initown. UoI, like most universities, is a hidebound and bureaucratic institution, but in Initown, that’s creating a problem. Initown has recently seen a minor boom in the tech sector, and now the School of Sciences is setting IT policy for the entire university.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Derek</strong> manages the Business School’s IT support team, and thus his days are spent hand-holding MBA students through how to copy files over to a thumb drive, and babysitting professors who want to fax an email to the department chair. He’s allowed to <em>hire</em> student workers, but cannot fire them. He’s allowed to purchase consumables like paper and toner, but has to beg permission for capital assets like mice and keyboards. He can set direction and provide input to software purchase decisions, but he also has to continue to support the DOS version of WordPerfect because one professor writes all their papers using it. <!-- And that professor's name? George R. R. Martin. --></p>\r\n<p class=\"inset\"><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Black_YubiKey_08.jpg#/media/File:Black_YubiKey_08.jpg\"><img itemprop=\"image\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Black_YubiKey_08.jpg/1200px-Black_YubiKey_08.jpg\" alt=\"A YubiKey in its holder, along with an instruction card describing its use.\"/></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One day, to his surprise, he received a notification from the Technology Council, the administrative board that set IT policy across the entire University. “We now support Two-Factor Authentication”. Derek, being both technologically savvy and security conscious, was one of the first people to sign up, and he pulled his entire staff along with him. It made sense: they were all young, technologically competent, and had smartphones that could run the school’s 2FA app. He <em>encouraged</em> their other customers to join them, but given that at least three professors didn’t use email and instead had the department secretary print out emails, there were some battles that simply weren’t worth fighting. <!-- I'll be honest, I've generally been a holdout on 2FA. Part of it is because until (relatively) recently, a lot of Internet 2FA systems used text messages, and I generally don't like paying for text messages. Now that there's apps for most of this, I use it more often. I don't mind pressing \"yes\" on my phone once in awhile. Weirdly, the Steam iPhone app gives me my 2FA tokens, but I can't actually log in from the iPhone app. Not that I browse steam from my phone in the first place, it's just weird. --></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three months went by, which is an eyeblink in University Time™. There was no further direction from the Technology Council. Within the Business School, very little happened with 2FA. A few faculty members, especially the ones fresh from the private sector, signed up. Very few tenured professors did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And then Derek received this email:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>To: <em>AllITSManagers<br/>\r\nFrom: ITS-Adminsd@initown.edu<br/>\r\nSubject: Two-Factor Authentication<br/>\r\nEffective two weeks from today, we will be requiring 2FA to be enabled on </em>all* accounts on the network, including student accounts. Please see attached, and communicate the changes to your customers.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Rolling out a change of this scale in two weeks would be a daunting task in any environment. Trying to get University faculty to change <em>anything</em> in a two week period was doomed to fail. Adding <em>students</em> to the mix promised to be a disaster. Derek read the attached “Transition Plan” document, hoping to see a cunning plan to manage the rollout. It was 15 pages of “Two-Factor Authentication(2FA) is more secure, and is an industry best practice,” and “The University President wants to see this change happen”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Derek compiled a list of all of his concerns- it was a long list- and raised it to his boss. His boss shrugged: “Those are the orders”. Derek escalated up through the business school administration, and after two days of frantic emails and, “Has anyone actually thought this through?” Derek was promised 5 minutes at the end of the next Technology Council meeting… which was <em>one</em> week before the deadline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Technology Council met in one of the administrative conference rooms in a recently constructed building named after a rich alumni who paid for the building. The room was shiny and packed with teleconferencing equipment that had never properly been configured, and thus was useless. It also had a top-of-the-line SmartBoard display, which was also in the same unusable state. <!-- So, way back in the day, I served as the student liaison for the technology council at my tiny college. I made the horrible mistake of actually trying to engage with my fellow students, and was kicked off after a few months, and replaced by somebody who just sat in on meetings and nodded along with the administrators and faculty who made real decisions. In retrospect, I may have also just been too much of an asshole about my disagreements. In general, it's a safe bet that I was a giant asshole $X years ago relative to the kind of asshole I am now. --></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Derek was finally acknowledged by the council, he started with his questions. “So, I’ve read through the Transition Plan document,” he said, “but I don’t see anything about how we’re going to on-board new customers to this process. How is everyone going to use it?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“They’ll just use the smartphone app,” the Chair said. “We’re making things more secure by using two-factor.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Right, but over in the Business School, we’ve got a lot of faculty that don’t <em>have</em> smartphones.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Administrator #2, seated to the Chair’s left, chimed in, “They can just receive a text. This is making things more secure.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Okay,” Derek said, “but we’ve still got faculty without cellphones. Or even desk phones. Or even <em>desks</em> for that matter. Adjunct professors don’t <em>get</em> offices, but they still need their email.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was a beat of silence as the Chair and Administrators considered this. Administrator #1 triumphantly pounded the conference table and declared, “They can use a hardware token!

        "description": "<blockquote>As this is a holiday week, per our usual tradition, we're revisiting some of the most popular articles from the year. We start with <a href=\"https://thedailywtf.com/articles/the-second-factor\">The Second Factor</a>, a tale of security gone wrong. -- Remy</blockquote><p>Famed placeholder company Initech is named for its hometown, Initown. Initech recruits heavily from their hometown school, the University of Initown. UoI, like most universities, is a hidebound and bureaucratic institution, but in Initown, that&rsquo;s creating a problem. Initown has recently seen a minor boom in the tech sector, and now the School of Sciences is setting IT policy for the entire university.</p><p><strong>Derek</strong> manages the Business School&rsquo;s IT support team, and thus his days are spent hand-holding MBA students through how to copy files over to a thumb drive, and babysitting professors who want to fax an email to the department chair. He&rsquo;s allowed to <em>hire</em> student workers, but cannot fire them. He&rsquo;s allowed to purchase consumables like paper and toner, but has to beg permission for capital assets like mice and keyboards. He can set direction and provide input to software purchase decisions, but he also has to continue to support the DOS version of WordPerfect because one professor writes all their papers using it. <!-- And that professor's name? George R. R. Martin. --></p><p class=\"inset\"><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Black_YubiKey_08.jpg#/media/File:Black_YubiKey_08.jpg\"><img itemprop=\"image\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Black_YubiKey_08.jpg/1200px-Black_YubiKey_08.jpg\" alt=\"A YubiKey in its holder, along with an instruction card describing its use.\"/><img/></a></p><p>One day, to his surprise, he received a notification from the Technology Council, the administrative board that set IT policy across the entire University. &ldquo;We now support Two-Factor Authentication&rdquo;. Derek, being both technologically savvy and security conscious, was one of the first people to sign up, and he pulled his entire staff along with him. It made sense: they were all young, technologically competent, and had smartphones that could run the school&rsquo;s 2FA app. He <em>encouraged</em> their other customers to join them, but given that at least three professors didn&rsquo;t use email and instead had the department secretary print out emails, there were some battles that simply weren&rsquo;t worth fighting. <!-- I'll be honest, I've generally been a holdout on 2FA. Part of it is because until (relatively) recently, a lot of Internet 2FA systems used text messages, and I generally don't like paying for text messages. Now that there's apps for most of this, I use it more often. I don't mind pressing \"yes\" on my phone once in awhile. Weirdly, the Steam iPhone app gives me my 2FA tokens, but I can't actually log in from the iPhone app. Not that I browse steam from my phone in the first place, it's just weird. --></p><p>Three months went by, which is an eyeblink in University Time&trade;. There was no further direction from the Technology Council. Within the Business School, very little happened with 2FA. A few faculty members, especially the ones fresh from the private sector, signed up. Very few tenured professors did.</p><p>And then Derek received this email:</p><blockquote><p>To: <em>AllITSManagers<br/>\r\nFrom: ITS-Adminsd@initown.edu<br/>\r\nSubject: Two-Factor Authentication<br/>\r\nEffective two weeks from today, we will be requiring 2FA to be enabled on </em>all* accounts on the network, including student accounts. Please see attached, and communicate the changes to your customers.</p></blockquote><p>Rolling out a change of this scale in two weeks would be a daunting task in any environment. Trying to get University faculty to change <em>anything</em> in a two week period was doomed to fail. Adding <em>students</em> to the mix promised to be a disaster. Derek read the attached &ldquo;Transition Plan&rdquo; document, hoping to see a cunning plan to manage the rollout. It was 15 pages of &ldquo;Two-Factor Authentication(2FA) is more secure, and is an industry best practice,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The University President wants to see this change happen&rdquo;.</p><p>Derek compiled a list of all of his concerns- it was a long list- and raised it to his boss. His boss shrugged: &ldquo;Those are the orders&rdquo;. Derek escalated up through the business school administration, and after two days of frantic emails and, &ldquo;Has anyone actually thought this through?&rdquo; Derek was promised 5 minutes at the end of the next Technology Council meeting&hellip; which was <em>one</em> week before the deadline.</p><p>The Technology Council met in one of the administrative conference rooms in a recently constructed building named after a rich alumni who paid for the building. The room was shiny and packed with teleconferencing equipment that had never properly been configured, and thus was useless. It also had a top-of-the-line SmartBoard display, which was also in the same unusable state. <!-- So, way back in the day, I served as the student liaison for the technology council at my tiny college. I made the horrible mistake of actually trying to engage with my fellow students, and was kicked off after a few months, and replaced by somebody who just sat in on meetings and nodded along with the administrators and faculty who made real decisions. In retrospect, I may have also just been too much of an asshole about my disagreements. In general, it's a safe bet that I was a giant asshole $X years ago relative to the kind of asshole I am now. --></p><p>When Derek was finally acknowledged by the council, he started with his questions. &ldquo;So, I&rsquo;ve read through the Transition Plan document,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t see anything about how we&rsquo;re going to on-board new customers to this process. How is everyone going to use it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll just use the smartphone app,&rdquo; the Chair said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re making things more secure by using two-factor.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right, but over in the Business School, we&rsquo;ve got a lot of faculty that don&rsquo;t <em>have</em> smartphones.&rdquo;</p><p>Administrator #2, seated to the Chair&rsquo;s left, chimed in, &ldquo;They can just receive a text. This is making things more secure.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Derek said, &ldquo;but we&rsquo;ve still got faculty without cellphones. Or even desk phones. Or even <em>desks</em> for that matter. Adjunct professors don&rsquo;t <em>get</em> offices, but they still need their email.&rdquo;</p><p>There was a beat of silence as the Chair and Administrators considered this. Administrator #1 triumphantly pounded the conference table and declared, &ldquo;They can use a hardware token! This will make our network more secure!&rdquo;</p><p>Administrator #2 winced. &ldquo;Ah&hellip; this project doesn&rsquo;t have a budget for hardware tokens. It&rsquo;s a capital expense, you see&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the Chair said, &ldquo;it can come out of their department&rsquo;s budget.

Edison</span></p></blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Does your ideation session with your teammates turn into just another meeting with a few people squabbling and the rest keeping quiet? How do you enhance the likelihood of having successful ideation sessions? While producing new ideas might not be difficult considering how frequently ideas come and go, producing great ideas often requires some inspiration and implementing some scientifically proven techniques of ideation.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&rsquo;s time to let go of conventional, boring idea generation tactics. How about trying some innovative and fun ideation techniques to generate better solutions and ideas?</span></p><h2><b>Techniques That Encourage Ideation</b></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They can be structured and organized or be plain silly!</span></p><h3><b>1. Brainstorming</b></h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brainstorming is the most common and the most popular ideation technique in almost every industry. It&rsquo;s also one of the best ways to generate many ideas as a team than what you can achieve sitting and thinking alone. Brainstorming is all about the quantity of ideas and not the quality. The intention of a brainstorming session is to think collectively. Each individual in the group should tune up the generative part of their brain and tone down the evaluative part. They should engage with each other, listen, and build on ideas.</span><br/><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, freestyle brainstorming might not lead to substantial ideas. The linear brainstorming process at </span><a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3061059/how-to-brainstorm-like-a-googler\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> includes the following steps:</span></p><ol><li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Know the user</span></li><li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Think 10x</span></li><li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Prototype</span></li></ol><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To ensure that your brainstorming sessions are effective, follow these best practices:</span></p><ol><li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Set a time limit to the brainstorm mode. During this time, the only goal should be to come up with as many ideas as possible. Judging the ideas generated during this period is strictly prohibited.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Start the session with a problem statement, a plan, a goal, a point of view, or &ldquo;how can we&rdquo; questions. Whatever the topic is, stay focused on it. The father of brainstorming, </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Faickney_Osborn\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alex F. Osborn</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, emphasized the inefficiency of brainstorming sessions that address multiple questions. </span></li><li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Don&rsquo;t judge, evaluate, or criticize any idea even in the form of non-verbal actions. As the facilitator of the brainstorming session, you should set a positive tone that allows the participants to feel confident.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Encourage crazy, wacky, and even weird ideas. The more creative the thinking process, the better the idea might be.</span></li></ol><h3><b>2. Gamestorming</b></h3><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19415\" src=\"http://blog.hackerearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Ideation-1-1.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"313\" srcset=\"http://blog.hackerearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Ideation-1-1.jpeg 640w, http://blog.hackerearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Ideation-1-1-300x147.jpeg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\"/><img/></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: </span><a href=\"http://www.imagethink.net/game-storming-sxswi/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ImageThink</span></a></span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having a playful way to brainstorm often leads to a surge in creativity. Gamestorming is the combination of brainstorming and gamification. It involves a set of problem-solving and ideation methods that are gamified in just to increase the level of energy, engagement, and collaboration during brainstorming sessions. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some examples of gamestorming sessions include:</span></p><h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>1.</em><em><strong>Cover story</strong>:</em> This gamestorming involves the use of a template that makes the participants generate a cover story, including the main image, a headline, sidebars with relevant facts, quotes, etc. This is a great technique for vision generation sessions as it uses the primary characteristics of a broad subject to create a cohesive picture.</span></h4><h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>2. <strong>Fishbowl</strong>:</em> In this ideation session, participants are required to sit in two circles, where the larger one surrounds the smaller circle. Participants in one of the circles brainstorm while those in the other observe, listen, and take notes without saying anything. This gives everyone a chance to engage in the brainstorming session.</span></h4><h3><b>3. SCAMPER</b></h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This ideation technique is an acronym with each letter representing an action verb that prompts creative ideas. The letters stand for:</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>S</strong> &ndash; <strong>S</strong>ubstitute</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>C</strong> &ndash; <strong>C</strong>ombine</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>A</strong> &ndash; <strong>A</strong>dapt</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>M</strong> &ndash; <strong>M</strong>odify</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>P</strong> &ndash; <strong>P</strong>ut to another use</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>E</strong> &ndash; <strong>E</strong>liminate </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>R</strong> &ndash; <strong>R</strong>everse</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Developed by </span><a href=\"https://books.google.co.in/books/about/Scamper.html?id=0Gmx_jr64RMC&amp;redir_esc=y\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bob Eberle</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, SCAMPER is a checklist that uses action verbs as stimuli to come up with new ideas for making a new product or modifying an existing product.</span></p><h3><b>4. Questioning assumptions</b></h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conventional thoughts and assumptions often take up a lot of thought space in our head. Freeing yourself from these makes it easier to generate great ideas. Almost every industry has certain deep-rooted orthodox beliefs they follow. These unspoken principles act as blinders (like the ones horses wear) that don&rsquo;t allow one to see new possibilities and ideas. Bryan W. Mattimore, author of &nbsp;&ldquo;Idea Stormers: How to Lead and Inspire Creative Breakthroughs,&rdquo; outlines in his book the impact questioning assumptions has on ideation. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In his book, Mattimore tells the story of Gary Fraser, his colleague, who had to face larger and established competitors (Crest and Colgate) in the toothpaste industry after taking over the oral care business unit at Unilever. From a product standpoint, he couldn&rsquo;t compete with them. He also couldn&rsquo;t spend more than them in marketing. The solution was to question every aspect of the toothpaste business. And the result was Mentadent, the first and a very successful baking soda and peroxide toothpaste in the world.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To question assumptions in your industry, first generate a set of, say, 20 to 30, assumptions, They can be true or false. Pick some of these and use them as the trigger for new ideas. Do consider every aspect of your business while generating the assumptions, including consumer beliefs, product positioning, materials, manufacturing, distribution, and pricing.</span></p><h3><b>5. Mind mapping</b></h3><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19417\" src=\"http://blog.hackerearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Ideation-2.png\" alt=\"Mind mapping: Top 12 Ideation Techniques\" width=\"1136\" height=\"766\" srcset=\"http://blog.hackerearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Ideation-2.png 1136w, http://blog.hackerearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Ideation-2-300x202.png 300w, http://blog.hackerearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Ideation-2-768x518.png 768w, http://blog.hackerearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Ideation-2-1024x690.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1136px) 100vw, 1136px\"/><img/></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: </span><a href=\"https://www.mindmeister.com/blog/mind-maps-essay-writing/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MeisterLabs</span></a></span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a graphical technique that makes participants imagine connections between different sets of ideas or information. Mind mapping involves writing down each idea and then connecting each of them by lines or curves to facts or ideas related to them, thus creating a web of relationships. It was a UK researcher, Tony Buzan, who developed &ldquo;mind mapping&rdquo; and discussed it in his book &ldquo;Use your Head,&rdquo; published in 1972. This technique enables sharing of ideas and concepts by capturing attention and framing information.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To apply mind mapping to your brainstorming session, ask the participants to write a word or a key phrase in the center of the board/page. Then, ask them to write anything and everything that comes to their mind on the same page. Finally, ask them to make connections as explained earlier.</span></p><h3><b>6. Daydreaming</b></h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although daydreaming doesn&rsquo;t earn any approval from most thought leaders, it is one of the most important ways to generate new ideas. Take the airplane for example. If the Wright brothers hadn&rsquo;t had a wild imagination triggered by daydreaming about flying, transportation wouldn&rsquo;t have been as seamless as it is today. Daydreaming, most often, is a playful thought process that dwells on a person&rsquo;s creativity and ingenuity to work on a problem. It allows the person to develop an emotional connection with that problem, which triggers new ideas.</span></p><h3><b>7. Redefining opportunities</b></h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although deceptively simple, this technique is highly effective. And it sure removes the blinders you might not have realized you had on. In this technique, you have to first create a statement that defines your creative objective. This is your opportunity statement. In the next step, pick any three, preferably the most interesting, words in your opportunity statement and create creative alternatives for all of them using the 5Ws and H of your problem&mdash;who, what, when, where, why, and how. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Place your three lists in a table format, arranged in columns under the original words (placed at the top of each column). Finally, select one word randomly from each column and plug it into your original opportunity statement and create new variations of the statement to redefine your opportunity. These are crazy combinations, no doubt. And they&rsquo;re not necessarily the last stage of this idea generation technique. However, they are great triggers for new ideas as they allow you to see more possibilities than what you might have considered before.</span></p><h3><b>8. Wishful thinking</b></h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another ideation technique outlined by Mattimore, this technique seeks you to wish for the impossible and then find ways to make it possible with the help of brainstorming. Let your imagination go wild, but also ensure that your wishes are tangible. These wishes can be your creative stimuli to generate more realistic ideas. </span></p><h3><b>9. Brainwalking / Brainwriting</b></h3><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19418\" src=\"http://blog.hackerearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Ideation-3.png\" alt=\" Brainwalking / Brainwriting: Top 12 Ideation Techniques\" width=\"714\" height=\"1075\" srcset=\"http://blog.hackerearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Ideation-3.png 714w, http://blog.hackerearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Ideation-3-199x300.png 199w, http://blog.hackerearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Ideation-3-680x1024.png 680w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 714px) 100vw, 714px\"/><img/></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: </span><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Figure-4-Outcome-of-the-brainwriting-and-clustering-activities-part-2_279475246_fig4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Research Gate</span></a></span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a flexible technique that can also be applied to the other techniques. It gives everyone in your group an opportunity to contribute their thoughts and ideas. Brainwalking or brainwriting involves participants writing their ideas on one piece of paper among the several pieces that the facilitator places on a wall/whiteboard. They keep rotating, adding to their own thoughts or building upon their colleagues&rsquo; ideas. The group can also do this by sitting in a circle and passing the papers from one person to the other after brainstorming for a few minutes. The diversity of ideas this technique creates is phenomenal.</span></p><h3><b>10. Worst possible idea</b></h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A fun technique that gets the creative juices flowing, the worst possible idea was also introduced by Mattimore in his book. He exemplifies the technique with the help of a scenario where he was helping a group of bankers to generate innovative ideas. Even after hours of ideating, they couldn&rsquo;t come up with anything noteworthy. So as a last resort, Mattimore introduced asked them to list the worst possible ideas. This activity not only allowed the banker to have some fun but also led to positive ideation sessions in the future. Sometimes, it is better to go for the bad ideas than the good ones. This takes some pressure off the participants and allows them to be more adventurous and creative with their thoughts.</span></p><h3><b>11. Six thinking hats</b></h3><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19419\" src=\"http://blog.hackerearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Ideation-4.jpeg\" alt=\"Six thinking hats: Top 12 Ideation techniques\" width=\"2500\" height=\"2094\" srcset=\"http://blog.hackerearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Ideation-4.jpeg 2500w, http://blog.hackerearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Ideation-4-300x251.jpeg 300w, http://blog.hackerearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Ideation-4-768x643.jpeg 768w, http://blog.hackerearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Ideation-4-1024x858.jpeg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2500px) 100vw, 2500px\"/><img/></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: </span><a href=\"http://floridacsi.com/six-thinking-hats/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Florida Customer Service Institute</span></a></span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Developed by Edward de Bono, a psychologist, consultant, and author, this technique was pioneered by him in his book &ldquo;Six Thinking Hats,&rdquo; published in 1985. This technique allows participants in a group to put themselves in each other&rsquo;s shoes. Six Thinking Hats involves dividing ideas into six directions of thought:</span></p><ul><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>White hat:</strong></em> Data, facts, and information</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>Red hat:</strong></em> Emotions</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>Green hat:</strong></em> Ideas</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>Yellow hat:</strong></em> Positives</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>Black hat</strong></em>: Negatives or critical judgment</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>Blue hat:</strong></em> Control and overview</span></li></ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each hat in this technique signifies a distinct set of perspectives and priorities that will allow you to consider your project from a variety of angles. When you have a new problem, let each member in your group put on one of the hats. Companies that use the Six Thinking Hats technique for ideation in their day-to-day operations include Prudential Insurance, Siemens, Boeing, Honeywell, Motorola, Fidelity Investments, Eli Lilly, National Semiconductor, and many more.</span></p><h3><b>12. Creative pause</b></h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just as important as the other techniques of ideation is the creative pause, which de Bono spoke of in his book &ldquo;Serious Creativity.&rdquo; A creative pause gives you the time to pause, take a step back, and reflect and re-approach a problem with a fresh mind. It encourages proactive thinking rather than reactive thinking.</span></p><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you&rsquo;re finding ideation a challenge, brainstorming individually or in a group can get you out of the rut. Try any of these techniques to come up with great ideas and cultivate a creative approach to ideation.</span></p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://blog.hackerearth.com/top-12-ideation-techniques-to-brainstorm-new-ideas\">Top 12 ideation techniques to brainstorm your way to new ideas</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://blog.hackerearth.com\">HackerEarth Blog</a>.</p>"

It was pretty vague and broad, without an actionable plan. I just had the intuition&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;the software configuration and tuning, especially after the adoption of microservices, was getting too complex.</p><h4 name=\"4305\" id=\"4305\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">The increasing complexity of configuring and tuning&nbsp;systems</h4><p name=\"b8e7\" id=\"b8e7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">If you have enough experience in the software industry, then it&rsquo;s very likely that you&rsquo;ve struggled with either a configuration problem or a tuning problem.</p><p name=\"a62d\" id=\"a62d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Configuration and tuning problems are pretty common and can lead to really bad outages. They often occur when:</p><ol class=\"postList\"><li name=\"3517\" id=\"3517\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">Some parts of the system are poorly or wrongly configured, or</li><li name=\"ba48\" id=\"ba48\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">A configuration that worked before now doesn&rsquo;t work because the context of the system has changed.</li></ol><p name=\"30d4\" id=\"30d4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">Think of a number of database replicas and their writing schemes. Or in Postgresql, think of the number of shared buffers, effective cache size, and the min and max wal size.</p><p name=\"c10e\" id=\"c10e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If wrongly configured from the start, it won&rsquo;t work in the given context, plain and simple. What&rsquo;s more interesting, though, is if it&rsquo;s <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">correctly</em> configured, it might work at a given time. But as the context changes&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;system workload, system resources usage, overall system architecture&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;the system will behave poorly. Or, even worse, an outage might happen.</p><p name=\"e482\" id=\"e482\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This will, inevitably, lead to manually-performed operations and the creation of heuristics. In other words, it will lead to:</p><blockquote name=\"91cf\" id=\"91cf\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\">Oh, we should set X to A, when workload is T, but it should be A+10 when workload is T+100 and we have system resources usage above 80%&hellip; I guess. Or maybe let&rsquo;s just up a queue in front of this component, queues solve everything, right?</blockquote><p name=\"200a\" id=\"200a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">Now multiply this scenario by tens or hundreds of services. Think for a second about the cognitive burden resulting from these configurations.</p><p name=\"dab3\" id=\"dab3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This is not a new concern. In 2003, Ganek and Corbi <a href=\"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5386835/?reload=true\" data-href=\"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5386835/?reload=true\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">discussed</a> the need for autonomic computing to handle the complexity of managing software systems. They noted that managing complex systems became too costly, labor-intensive, and prone to error due to the pressure engineers felt while maintaining them. This increased the potential of system outages with a concurrent impact on business.</p><p name=\"66f5\" id=\"66f5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Even nowadays, most of the configurations and tuning of the systems are performed manually, often in run-time, which is known to be a very time-consuming and risky practice.

So why not delegate these tasks to something that excels at exactly that? <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Machine learning sounds like a feasible tool for the job.</em></p><p name=\"262b\" id=\"262b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">After starting my Masters at the University of British Columbia, I kept working on this idea. It seemed interesting although quite weird, and, sometimes, unpractical and impossible to implement.</p><p name=\"5857\" id=\"5857\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">To my surprise, I realized I wasn&rsquo;t alone. Some very interesting people were working on these ideas&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;so it might not be that weird, unpractical, and impossible.</p><p name=\"d3b9\" id=\"d3b9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Recently, Jeff Dean&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;a man that I admire a lot&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15892956\" data-href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15892956\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">gave a talk at NIPS 2017 talking about machine learning for systems</a>, where he stated:</p><blockquote name=\"7f6e\" id=\"7f6e\" class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\">Learning should be used throughout our computing systems. Traditional low-level systems code (operating systems, compilers, storage systems) does not make extensive use of machine learning today. This should&nbsp;change!</blockquote><blockquote name=\"00a8\" id=\"00a8\" class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--pullquote\">Computer Systems are filled with heuristics: compilers, networking code, operating systems. Heuristics have to work well &ldquo;in general case&rdquo;. [They] generally don&rsquo;t adapt to actual pattern of usage and don&rsquo;t take into account available context</blockquote><blockquote name=\"1d0d\" id=\"1d0d\" class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--pullquote\">Learning in the core of all of our computer systems will make them better/more adaptive.</blockquote><p name=\"c712\" id=\"c712\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">I was in complete awe when I read this. One of the engineers I admire the most was talking about the very same ideas I&rsquo;ve been thinking about and working on.</p><p name=\"d288\" id=\"d288\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This led me to think that it&rsquo;s not only interesting but <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">natural to think about enhancing software systems with machine learning.</strong> Throughout the whole software stack, we have many heuristics that, although they work well, could be improved by machine learning.</p><p name=\"5770\" id=\"5770\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Is it challenging and potentially risky? Yes, most definitely. Especially given that interpretability, apparently, has become a secondary goal in the machine learning community. How can we interpret and explain the decisions made by neural nets?</p><p name=\"31e3\" id=\"31e3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">However, with that said, these obstacles shouldn&rsquo;t hinder scientific and technological progress. <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.01208.pdf\" data-href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.01208.pdf\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Yes, we should question old paradigms </a>and try to improve things.</p><figure name=\"95d8\" id=\"95d8\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 251px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 35.8%;\"></div><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*puiL2EVDE6Ztlocw3JD1uQ.png\" data-width=\"779\" data-height=\"279\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*puiL2EVDE6Ztlocw3JD1uQ.png\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*puiL2EVDE6Ztlocw3JD1uQ.png\"/></div></figure><h4 name=\"1881\" id=\"1881\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure\">Towards machine learning-enhanced software&nbsp;systems</h4><p name=\"8643\" id=\"8643\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">As Jeff Dean pointed out: we need to find <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">practical</strong> ways to make systems data-aware. We need systems that collect metrics and metadata about themselves. To achieve this, we could learn a thing a two from the ideas in systems observability and instrumentation. We have been instrumenting systems for decades, and the data is already there.</p><p name=\"445a\" id=\"445a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">We also need to find <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">practical</strong> and <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">clean</strong> ways to <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">integrate</strong> machine learning components into software systems, making learning a first-class citizen in the system. This will lead to <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">systems that learn how to improve themselves,</strong> beating heuristics and manually-performed operations. Think about this for a second. It does sound cool <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">and</em> feasible.</p><p name=\"f2d1\" id=\"f2d1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I would also add that we need <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">practical</strong> and <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">clean</strong> ways to propagate the decisions made by the learned models to the rest of the system. This would allow the system to have self-adaptive capabilities. Here, we could learn something from the control theory community.</p><p name=\"751f\" id=\"751f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The general idea is fairly simple: make a system learn about its behavior by training a model on its context. Then allow it to change its structures and configurations in order to optimize for a certain scenario. Now implement this idea in such a way that it could be possible to integrate it into many kinds of systems.</p><h4 name=\"edb8\" id=\"edb8\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Summary</h4><p name=\"b5d6\" id=\"b5d6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">The most interesting questions I have in mind are:</p><ol class=\"postList\"><li name=\"06e6\" id=\"06e6\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">Can self-adaptation by learned models lead to more stable, faster, safer software systems? Can it reduce the need for manually configuring and tuning systems, allowing engineers to focus on more important tasks?</li><li name=\"c151\" id=\"c151\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Can this be easily integrated into software systems, requiring only small changes to the codebase?</li><li name=\"4428\" id=\"4428\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Can this work with low overhead?</li></ol><p name=\"e061\" id=\"e061\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">It is worth noting that this <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">would not</strong> replace good engineers, but would rather free the engineers&rsquo; cognitive abilities to focus on what matters.</p><p name=\"430a\" id=\"430a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\"><a href=\"http://www.sysml.cc/\" data-href=\"http://www.sysml.cc/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">I genuinely believe that this will become a trend in the next few years</a>. I myself am working on these ideas as part of my graduate studies, and I will be posting the results of my research, so <a href=\"https://twitter.com/digorithm\" data-href=\"https://twitter.com/digorithm\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">stay tuned</a>.</p></div></div></section></div>"

        "description": "<p><em>Our product team has been working on something so interesting, I asked them to share some of the insights we&rsquo;ve discovered.</em></p><p><em>Alistair Clark, one of our product developers, has been speaking with people who have already done the basics of personal finance: These people have already set up automated savings accounts and invested. Many have accumulated considerable amounts of money in the hundreds of thousands (or millions) of dollars.</em></p><p><em>So what&rsquo;s next? What do you do when you&rsquo;ve already done the basics of personal finance?</em></p><p><em>Alistair got the kind of behind-the-scenes access that few of us have. He spoke to wealthy people about their hopes, fears, and dreams around money &mdash; and discovered that once you&rsquo;re at a more advanced level, your concerns change. Your goals change. And whether you intended to or not, your lifestyle changes.</em></p><p><em>Let&rsquo;s see what he found.</em></p><p><em>Alistair, take it away&hellip;</em></p><p>_</p><p id=\"email\">Every week, Ramit gets thousands of emails with questions about personal finance.</p><p>99% of the time, his answer is the same: &ldquo;Go read my book, <em>I Will Teach You to be Rich.</em>&rdquo;</p><p>But 1% of the time, he gets a really interesting email that doesn&rsquo;t have a simple answer, and he&rsquo;ll forward it over to the IWT product team to see if we can help.</p><p>For example, check out this email a reader sent to Ramit after reading the IWT book:</p><blockquote><p><em>It&rsquo;s too beginner for me. I finished because of the entertaining style </em><em>and I like to vet books</em><em>&nbsp;before recommending them. My stage is this:</em></p><ol><li><em>Zero debt&hellip; pay credit cards to zero, twice a month. Paid off my mortgage 25 years early ($230k). Haven&rsquo;t paid a car loan in over 5 years. And my twins are now in school (so no more $1,500/mo child care any longer).</em></li><li><em>I&rsquo;m self-made with a video production/photography business + my wife is a psychologist with the VA, so we have a decent income. </em></li><li><em>We each have contributed $18k into our 401ks (mine is a solo-k) for years.</em></li><li><em>We have maxed our ROTHs for about 7 years each (more on this later).</em></li><li><em>We are very frugal (our two spending items are 1. quality food (groceries) and 2. travel).</em></li><li><em>I&rsquo;m about to turn 38, wife is 34.</em></li><li><em>We have $750k-$775k invested/saved and adding our house puts us over a million. </em></li></ol><p><em>WHAT NOW!?!</em></p></blockquote><p>At IWT, we love seeing emails&nbsp;like this. Here&rsquo;s someone who actually took action, implemented our personal finance advice, and is now in a great place with their finances.</p><p>From the outside in, there&rsquo;s absolutely nothing to worry about!&nbsp;And yet, we continue to get emails just like this from people worrying about their finances.</p><p>What&rsquo;s going on here? Why do we worry about money even though we&rsquo;re doing everything right?</p><h2>The psychology of why we worry about money</h2><p>In Ramit&rsquo;s book, he outlines what we call &ldquo;The Ladder of Personal Finance.&rdquo; People loved having a clear roadmap telling them exactly what to do next.</p><p><center><img style=\"border: solid 4px #ffffff; box-shadow: 0px 0px 3px 0px rgba(0,0,0,.15);\" src=\"https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/wp-content/uploads/pasted-image-0-421-e1513886719847.png\" class=\"wp-image-24049\" alt=\"pasted image 0 422\"/><em>&ldquo;The Ladder of Personal Finance&rdquo; from Ramit&rsquo;s book, </em>I Will Teach You To Be Rich</center></p><p>But eventually, you get to the end and there are no more rungs on the ladder. You&rsquo;ve checked all the boxes. All you&rsquo;re left with is that same empty feeling we had after finishing our favorite video game that we spent hours trying to master. Except&hellip; you don&rsquo;t have another game to play. With your finances, it can seem like the only thing left to do is sit and wait for the next 30 or 40 years until you retire.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know about you, but that sounds boring as hell.</p><p>I&rsquo;m impatient. I want to be optimizing, tweaking, and doing something to keep getting better every single day. If someone came to me tomorrow and said, &ldquo;OK Alistair, you&rsquo;ve checked all the boxes for your business. Now you just have to put it on autopilot and go sit on a beach for the next 30 years,&rdquo; <u><a href=\"https://growthlab.com/what-successful-people-dont-tell-you/\" target=\"_blank\">I&rsquo;d tell them they were crazy</a></u>.</p><p>Humans are problem-solving machines. We aren&rsquo;t good at sitting on our hands and being patient. For example, just <u><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVU6ANI059M\" target=\"_blank\">look at this video</a></u> of a woman in a self-driving car for the first time. Does she look relaxed? No! She is freaking out and worrying because she has nothing to do.</p><p>If money is supposed to buy us peace of mind, then why do some of us act just like this woman in the self-driving car? And what is the &ldquo;last mile&rdquo; that can get us to be more zen about our finances?&nbsp;</p><h2>3 things we noticed from people&nbsp;who don&rsquo;t worry about money</h2><p>As I mentioned above, I&rsquo;m on the product team here at IWT. We&rsquo;re in the course-making business, which means solving some gnarly problems for our readers. And this is the type of big question we LOVE to tackle to see if we can find interesting, counterintuitive solutions.</p><p>Over the past month, we&rsquo;ve been digging into the tactics and mindsets of the wealthy to find out what they do once they&rsquo;ve &ldquo;checked all the boxes&rdquo; and mastered the basics of personal finance.</p><p>How do they get to that enviable position where they never have to worry about money again? What do these carefree people know that we don&rsquo;t?</p><p>Today I&rsquo;d like to share three examples:</p><h3>1. They are prepared for everything</h3><p>Earlier this year, the <em>New Yorker</em>&nbsp;ran a fascinating article titled <u><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/01/30/doomsday-prep-for-the-super-rich\" target=\"_blank\">&ldquo;Doomsday Prep for the Super-Rich&rdquo;</a></u>. In the piece they described how some of the smartest, most successful people from Silicon Valley and Wall Street are preparing for the apocalypse&nbsp;(yes, you read that correctly).&nbsp;They are buying remote property, building self-sustaining bunkers, and sometimes even stockpiling ammunition to prepare for the eventual breakdown of civilization.</p><p>When asked the simple question of &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; here&rsquo;s what Yishan Wong, the former CEO of Reddit, told the <em>New Yorker</em>:</p><blockquote><p><em>Most people just assume improbable events don&rsquo;t happen, but technical people tend to view risk very mathematically &hellip; The tech preppers do not necessarily think a collapse is likely. They consider it a remote event, but one with a very severe downside, so, given how much money they have, spending a fraction of their net worth to hedge against this &hellip; is a logical thing to do.</em></p></blockquote><p>Maybe you&rsquo;re not ready to drop a few million on a bunker in rural Kansas, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t be prepared for the future.</p><p>In speaking to our students who worry about money, I&rsquo;ve noticed that a lot of people are afraid of unpredictable things that might happen in their future. Some people refer to these as &ldquo;the things you don&rsquo;t know that you don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; or &ldquo;unknown unknowns.&rdquo; Here&rsquo;s how one student described his fear:</p><blockquote><p><em>What worries me isn&rsquo;t job loss. What worries me is the million other things that could pop up. What&rsquo;s hiding around the corner that I don&rsquo;t know about?</em></p></blockquote><p>This type of fear can be incredibly powerful, because your imagination runs wild with worst-case scenarios. It&rsquo;s like when you are walking down the stairs into a pitch black basement of a rickety old house. It&rsquo;s terrifying. <em>Anything </em>could be lurking in those shadows.</p><p>But there&rsquo;s a simple solution: Turn on a light.</p><p>You can do the same thing with your finances. Instead of being afraid of &ldquo;unknown unknowns,&rdquo; you can shine a light on your financial future by learning from people ten years older than you who can tell you exactly what to expect.</p><p><u><a href=\"https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/already-handled-basics-save-money-get-ahead/\" target=\"_blank\">We call it the &ldquo;10 Year Savings Strategy&rdquo; and wrote about it here</a></u>.</p><h3>2. They protect the money they already have </h3><p>Ever see a news story about a rock star or athlete going bankrupt and wonder, &ldquo;How is it even possible to lose that much money?&rdquo;&nbsp;ESPN&rsquo;s documentary <em><u><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/30for30/film?page=broke\" target=\"_blank\">Broke</a></u></em>&nbsp;investigated the phenomenon of very rich athletes going completely broke. The statistics are shocking:</p><blockquote><p><em>According to a <u><a href=\"https://www.si.com/vault/2009/03/23/105789480/how-and-why-athletes-go-broke\" target=\"_blank\">2009 <em>Sports Illustrated article</em></a></u>, 60 percent of former NBA players are broke within five years of retirement. By the time they have been retired for two years, 78% of former NFL players have gone bankrupt or are under financial stress.</em></p></blockquote><p>One of the primary causes of financial problems for these athletes was not extravagant spending. It was mostly due to bad investments, ranging from real estate to restaurants to car washes. </p><p>It&rsquo;s an interesting cautionary tale because one of the most common questions I get from students who have &ldquo;mastered the basics&rdquo; of personal finance is &ldquo;How do I make my investments grow faster?&rdquo;</p><p>As your wealth grows, you&rsquo;ll find the investing opportunities start to grow as well. Instead of just a &ldquo;boring&rdquo; target date fund, now you can buy real estate, invest in start-ups, and take sizable positions in individual stocks. At a certain level,&nbsp;the world of hedge funds and private equity start to open up as well. It&rsquo;s tempting to throw your money at these exciting opportunities and promises of outsized returns&nbsp;and it&rsquo;s easy to&nbsp;develop&nbsp;an obsession with growth and moving faster.</p><p>I find this fascinating, because the research I&rsquo;ve done revealed that the most successful wealthy people have the <em>opposite</em>&nbsp;approach. Instead of asking&nbsp;&ldquo;what can I gain?&rdquo; their #1 question is &ldquo;how can I avoid losing money?&rdquo;</p><p>For example, Warren Buffett has <u><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0210/rules-that-warren-buffett-lives-by.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">two rules of investing</a></u>: </p><p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Rule 1: Never lose money.</em></p><p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Rule 2: Never forget rule 1.</em></p><p>So what does this mean for you?</p><p>This is more a matter of mastering your own psychology than any new tactic or fancy asset allocation. There&rsquo;s a reason at IWT we consistently recommend boring, simple investments like <u><a href=\"https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/lazy-portfolio/\" target=\"_blank\">lazy portfolios</a></u>&nbsp;and <u><a href=\"https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/asset-allocation-investor-psychology/\" target=\"_blank\">target date funds</a></u>.</p><p>But we&rsquo;ve also spent enough time studying the psychology of personal finance to know that being a 100% disciplined monk with your investments is near impossible. No matter how much you read about the merits of basic index investing and why stock picking never works, there&rsquo;s still a little voice in your head saying, &ldquo;Yeah, but what if I find the next Amazon stock? I&rsquo;d be a millionaire in five years!&rdquo;</p><p>Here&rsquo;s what we recommend: instead of suppressing that voice in your head, embrace it. Take 5% of your portfolio and put it aside for whatever crazy idea you have for making your money grow faster. Invest in Bitcoin. Buy $5,000 in Tesla stock. Invest in your cousin&rsquo;s car wash if you want.</p><p>Do whatever you want, because while you might lose that 5%, you can sleep well at night knowing 95% of your money is still safe and protected.</p><h3>3. They don&rsquo;t do it alone</h3><p>There&rsquo;s a great <u><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4P_vMXLhi2I\" target=\"_blank\">scene in <em>Entourage</em></a></u>&nbsp;where the agent Ari Gold is introducing the management team of actress and singer Mandy Moore. </p><p>(Heads up: You may want to put in headphones for that link, there&rsquo;s some NSFW language in that clip.)<em>&nbsp;</em></p><p>It&rsquo;s kind of eye-opening as he goes down the line introducing this super-team of six people who are required to manage the career of just one person: manager, music agent, publicist, attorney, music manager, theatrical agent, etc.</p><p>It&rsquo;s also possible to develop the same type of super-team to manage your finances and literally outsource your worry to someone else. Attorneys, accountants, life insurance specialists, financial planners, investment advisers, and even a psychologist or psychiatrist could all be part of your financial super-team.</p><p>You might be thinking, &ldquo;Wait, what? I thought Ramit hated financial advisors. Doesn&rsquo;t he spend an entire chapter in his book telling me NOT to hire a financial advisor. So what&rsquo;s going on here?&rdquo;</p><p>I asked Ramit about this incongruence, and he pointed out a really interesting and counterintuitive insight: Once you reach a certain point, the basic personal finance rules no longer apply.</p><p>Normal people with ordinary financial needs don&rsquo;t require an advisor. That&rsquo;s why we tell most people it&rsquo;s not worth their time. But once you&rsquo;ve conquered the basics, then the basic rules no longer apply.</p><p>Here are a few scenarios where it DOES make sense to pay an advisor:</p><ul><li>When you have a lot of investable assets (~$1MM+) and have much more to lose if you make a mistake.</li><li>If you have complex situations (imagine having three&nbsp;kids, planning for college, and buying a house at the exact same time).</li><li>When you just want a second set of eyes to make sure you have everything done right and aren&rsquo;t missing anything.</li><li>When you&rsquo;re short on time and want to pay for convenience (e.g., you can hire a bookkeeper who you forward bills to and who pays them for you).</li><li>When you run your own business, an accountant is a no-brainer who can &ldquo;cover your ass&rdquo; and also look out for things you don&rsquo;t know about.</li></ul><p>Is hiring an advisor expensive? Yes, of course. But ask yourself, how much is constantly worrying about your finances costing you?</p><p>If you&rsquo;re looking at getting help with your finances from a professional, then we&nbsp;recommend beginning your search at the National Association of Personal Finance Advisors (<u><a href=\"http://www.napfa.org\" target=\"_blank\">www.napfa.org</a></u>). These advisors are fee-based (they usually have an hourly rate), not commission-based, meaning that they want to help you, not profit off their recommendations.</p><p><center>***</center></p><p>If you read<em>&nbsp;I Will Teach You to be Rich,</em>&nbsp;applied everything, and you&rsquo;re now running into new, more advanced problems where there aren&rsquo;t clear answers&hellip; it can feel weird to bring stuff like that up to friends. &ldquo;Hi, do any of you know what to do after you max out your 401k and pay off your house? Thanks!&rdquo;</p><p>But here at IWT, you&rsquo;re with your fellow weirdos. It&rsquo;s safe, we promise. In the comments tell us how you&rsquo;ve &ldquo;leveled up&rdquo; and what you need help on next. We want to help.</p><p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/youve-done-everything-right-but-youre-still-worried-about-money-why/\">You&rsquo;ve done everything &ldquo;right&rdquo; but you&rsquo;re still worried about money.

And so within minutes of my lean branding exercise, I already had some positive feedback!</p><p name=\"f6b7\" id=\"f6b7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I then told them what I was building and asked if they could test in the following hours over the course of my build.</p><p name=\"c4a8\" id=\"c4a8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This led to real user feedback as I was building so that I could create a more realistic conversational design and flow for my chatbot.</p><p name=\"003a\" id=\"003a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">After getting setup on <a href=\"http://www.chatfuel.com\" data-href=\"http://www.chatfuel.com\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Chatfuel</a>, I watched some YouTube tutorials and used some of the templates provided on Chatfuel to learn through modifying (thanks <a href=\"http://personabots.com/\" data-href=\"http://personabots.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Persona</a>!).</p><p name=\"6968\" id=\"6968\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I realized that the process is fairly straightforward, and it was all about the conversational flow and user journey.</p><h4 name=\"674f\" id=\"674f\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">I Then Completed the Following Definition Exercise to Define What I Was Going to&nbsp;Build:</h4><ol class=\"postList\"><li name=\"fb13\" id=\"fb13\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--h4\">Map out the conversational flow and user journey. In this case, it was for a user to discover artists, view artwork, and purchase artwork.</li><li name=\"f8b7\" id=\"f8b7\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Define the structure of the bot. In Chatfuel, this is done by &ldquo;blocks,&rdquo; which I created for each main state, sub states, destinations, queries, and answers.</li><li name=\"c5de\" id=\"c5de\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Identify and also limit the amount of content that I would display. Since I was building this in hours, it was more about the experience and validation, rather then how robust I thought it should be.</li></ol><p name=\"279d\" id=\"279d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">Actually building the bot in Chatfuel began at the second step with the blocks. It was mid-afternoon Saturday now and I was feeling a bit overwhelmed with the ambitious complexities I initially set out to build.</p><p name=\"d123\" id=\"d123\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">To overcome this, I removed some of the artists, the artwork to show, and then the artwork available so that I could focus on a better experience rather then trying to account for quantity.</p><figure name=\"7ba2\" id=\"7ba2\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 410px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 58.599999999999994%;\"></div><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*wK8vVRCRUs8wN2DLySIcnw.png\" data-width=\"2114\" data-height=\"1238\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*wK8vVRCRUs8wN2DLySIcnw.png\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*wK8vVRCRUs8wN2DLySIcnw.png\"/></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Art Chatbot being built from the Chatfuel dashboard.</figcaption></figure><p name=\"02f5\" id=\"02f5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Before Saturday was over, I had completed the initial version of Art Chatbot. I had friends testing the chatbot and providing real feedback, and all of the social pages and assets were prepped to launch before the end of the weekend.</p><p name=\"0cae\" id=\"0cae\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">With this initial version completed, I spent Sunday feeling a bit less time-constrained. I was able to focus more on prepping for a launch along with continual chatbot iteration.</p><p name=\"18b5\" id=\"18b5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I also began implementing basic AI functionality into the bot. I messaged a few art technology companies to ask what data was valuable to them (knowing I could easily collect this). This way, I could be on their radar and possibly build a chatbot that had some monetary value through data down the road.</p><p name=\"c945\" id=\"c945\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I ended the day on Sunday by making a quick landing page using <a href=\"http://instapg.es/jHPw7\" data-href=\"http://instapg.es/jHPw7\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Instapage</a> and optimizing it for a Product Hunt launch that I would do Monday.</p><figure name=\"1d13\" id=\"1d13\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 506px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 72.3%;\"></div><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*CdleOwKip2abI7x4ob8xww.png\" data-width=\"1704\" data-height=\"1232\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*CdleOwKip2abI7x4ob8xww.png\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*CdleOwKip2abI7x4ob8xww.png\"/></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Created a <a href=\"http://www.artchatbot.com\" data-href=\"http://www.artchatbot.com\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">landing page</a> in a few minutes using Instapage and the content I used from the chatbot&nbsp;blocks.</figcaption></figure><p name=\"2646\" id=\"2646\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">To pre-launch the chatbot, I also setup <a href=\"http://botanalytics.co\" data-href=\"http://botanalytics.co\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Botanalytics</a> (to help monitor, track, and analyze messages), posted in <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/aichatbots/\" data-href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/aichatbots/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook Groups</a> to generate initial users, and then drafted my Product Hunt intro that I would post.</p><p name=\"7206\" id=\"7206\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I also used a Google doc to create all the verbiage I would share on my social channels. Then I could simply copy the text, add the Product Hunt URL, and share across channels on Monday.</p><p name=\"c2ce\" id=\"c2ce\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The result is that Art Chatbot hit 100 upvotes on <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/posts/art-chatbot\" data-href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/posts/art-chatbot\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Product Hunt</a> and had also sent over 1,800 messages by the end of the day.</p><p name=\"765e\" id=\"765e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I not only learned about chatbots, but I am more confident in my understanding of the technology through a real use case.

        "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, more companies around the world are welcoming a new addition to the C-suite&mdash;the chief innovation officer (CINO)&mdash;who is tasked with championing and guiding organization-wide innovation efforts. Although the term &ldquo;chief innovation officer&rdquo; was coined in 1998 by Miller and Morris in their book, </span><a href=\"http://as.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471240931.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fourth Generation R&amp;D: Managing Knowledge, Technology, and Innovation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it has gained currency only in recent years. Earlier, R&amp;D units used to be the bastions of innovation. Now, innovation has taken on a broader meaning (&ldquo;open innovation&rdquo;) and extends to people inside as well as outside organizations.</span></p><p><a href=\"https://www.accenture.com/t20160412T084615Z__w__/us-en/_acnmedia/PDF-10/Accenture-Innovation-Research-ExecSummary.pdf#zoom=50\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Accenture&rsquo;s 2015 US Innovation Survey</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> found that 63% of companies were appointing CINOs. This figure had increased by 9% from the survey that was conducted in 2009. </span><a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/innovationsurvey/files/innovation_full_report.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PwC&rsquo;s Global Innovation Survey 2017</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> provides further evidence that innovation is high up on the agenda of most firms. Of the 246 CEOs surveyed from around the world, 64% responded that innovation and operational effectiveness were equally important to the success of their company.</span></p><h2><b>So, what do successful innovation officers have in common?</b></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The CINO role is multidisciplinary and requires a combination of traits that are hard to find in each other&rsquo;s company. While the CEO is responsible for directing overall company strategy and creating a vision for the future, the CINO is required to take charge of the vision by taking calculated risks and creating a space for new ideas and creativity. </span></p><blockquote><p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CINOs are not necessarily great innovators, however they can recognize potential innovation opportunities and galvanize company will and resources toward them.</span></i></p></blockquote><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19408\" src=\"http://blog.hackerearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/innovation-managers-1.jpeg\" alt=\"What do top innovation managers and chief innovation officers have in common\" width=\"906\" height=\"522\" srcset=\"http://blog.hackerearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/innovation-managers-1.jpeg 906w, http://blog.hackerearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/innovation-managers-1-300x173.jpeg 300w, http://blog.hackerearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/innovation-managers-1-768x442.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 906px) 100vw, 906px\"/><img/></p><h2><b>1. Excellent People Management Skills</b></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Top innovation managers understand that collaboration is key. Among the first tasks of the CINO is the need to bridge the gaps between various C-level executives and gain organization-wide buy-in. It is important to engage the senior executive leadership team effectively instead of simply aiming for nodding acquiescence.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The CINO is able to communicate the company&rsquo;s vision to various levels of people such that it becomes their own. He/she can build connections both within and outside the company to enable the gathering of insights and inspirations that are necessary for the innovation cycle. He/she can also employ design thinking and promote his/her technology team.</span></p><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mkbhatt/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manoj Kumar</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Head of Innovations, Tata Trusts, believes that </span></p><blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ldquo;innovation is the lifeline of any business and if you don&rsquo;t, someone else will disrupt you out from your market.&rdquo; </span></p></blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He adds, </span></p><blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ldquo;I expect innovation offices to become the in-house incubator and accelerator of innovative ideas and create a pipeline of new solutions that can catapult the business on a non-linear growth trajectory.&rdquo;</span></p></blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since innovation efforts are usually met with apprehension, CINOs are able to align their innovation strategy with the company&rsquo;s strategy and quickly provide tangible proof of concepts or prototypes. This helps boost collaboration and enables more manual tasks to be automated.</span></p><h2><b>2. Excellent Communication Skills</b></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the reasons why innovation strategies are met with resistance is the fear of job loss. CINOs are able to explain the concepts of artificial intelligence in simple and relatable terms to all levels of people. They describe how jobs will not be lost. Instead, the nature of laborious jobs will change to allow employees to focus their time and efforts on more value-added tasks. Being able to explain high-level technology terms in simple language is necessary to put people at ease and gain their trust. CINOs demonstrate the credibility and feasibility of their innovation efforts by releasing actual prototypes for the employees to try. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ideally, CINOs should be seasoned professionals with the experience of handling several senior executive leaders. </span></p><h2><b>3. Keen Business Understanding</b></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if the CINO has not worked as an entrepreneur or an &ldquo;intrapreneur,&rdquo; it is important for him/her to think like one. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Top CINOs have a sharp understanding of the culture they are working in, which helps them decide when to follow precedent and when to take a new path. It also helps them gain insights into how to get buy-in to implement an innovation effectively. According to </span><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/srikantgopal/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Srikant Gopal</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, former vice president of global innovation at Nestle Purina Petcare, </span></p><blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ldquo;The way I look at it is, we can get some of the key stakeholders on board and get enough of them to neutralize the hopefully small minority of naysayers. In a large company, that's probably the most realistic outcome.\"</span></p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/press/bios/katharina-borchert/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Katharina Borchert</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Chief Innovation Officer at Mozilla, says,</span></p><blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &ldquo;The CINO role often includes analyzing trends and identifying emerging new market opportunities that guide investment decisions.&rdquo;</span></p></blockquote><h2><b>4. Adequate Technological Understanding</b></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CINOs may be defined as enablers who design processes and introduce best practices that allow the creation of a space for others to develop and drive novel concepts. CINOs do not necessarily hail from technical backgrounds, but have sufficient knowledge to enable them to assimilate technical data and derive intelligent conclusions. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although most companies have separate teams dedicated to technology watching, trend analysis, and market analysis, these teams do not communicate with one another to share their findings. The CINO focuses on boosting collaboration between these teams to enable intelligence-driven innovation.</span></p><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Innovation involves an in-depth understanding of an organization&rsquo;s business, its customers, competitors, and usage of data. </span><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/chandrahas-panigrahi-4266119/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chandrahas Panigrahi</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Chief Marketing Officer and Business Director of Acer India, says, </span></p><blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ldquo;The CINO role involves more responsibility compared to the fancy designation; other key requisites include analytical skills, excellent interpersonal skills, strong business knowledge, inquisitive and creative mind to develop inventive strategies and direct new projects.&rdquo;</span></p></blockquote><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://blog.hackerearth.com/what-top-innovation-managers-common\">What do top innovation managers have in common</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://blog.hackerearth.com\">HackerEarth Blog</a>.</p>"

When a project starts lagging, managers attempt to put it back on track by adding more resources. Thus, resource constraints are viewed as obstacles to innovation. </span><a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/us/en/advisory-services/business-innovation/assets/2017-innovation-benchmark-findings.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PwC&rsquo;s 2017 Innovation Benchmark Report</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> observes that &ldquo;over the past dozen years, our annual Global Innovation 1000 study has found no statistical relationship between dollars spent on innovation and financial performance, suggesting that the way you spend your innovation dollars is more important than how many of those dollars you spend.&rdquo;</span></p><h2><b>Resource-constrained innovation (RCI)</b></h2><p><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sangeeta_Ray/publication/224078899_Resource-Constrained_Innovation_for_Emerging_Economies_The_Case_of_the_Indian_Telecommunications_Industry/links/555a9a7508ae6fd2d828349d.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ray and Ray (2010)</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> used the term &ldquo;resource-constrained innovation (RCI)&rdquo; to describe innovation models that suit the needs of emerging markets, where low-cost, affordable products are in demand. RCI promises high customer benefit at a very low cost, thus making the product attractive and/or affordable for consumers with financial limitations. Ray and Ray identified three critical factors for RCI:</span></p><ul><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Entrepreneurial leadership and vision</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Modular designs to fulfill user demands of affordability, operability, and functionality through architectural innovation</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exploitation of the local knowledge base and creation of local innovation clusters</span></li></ul><h2><b>Ways to innovate with resource constraints</b></h2><p><a href=\"https://www.alexandria.unisg.ch/232147/1/ZeschkyWinterhalterGassmann_ISPIM2014_final.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zeschky, Winterhalter, and Gassmann (2014)</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> differentiated between four types of innovation methods that can be adopted when one has fewer financial resources&mdash;cost innovation, good-enough innovation, frugal innovation, and reverse innovation.</span></p><h3><b>Cost Innovation</b></h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cost innovation is not a new concept. It is applied through ongoing process improvements enabled using advantageous locations in low-cost countries. Cost innovations attract both poor and affluent consumers because they appeal to consumers seeking cost-efficiency as well as consumers with a limited budget. Williamson explored the term &ldquo;cost innovation&rdquo; in his 2010 paper &ldquo;</span><a href=\"http://www.businessmodelcommunity.com/fs/Root/8oex9-Williamson.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cost Innovation: Preparing for a &ldquo;Value-for-Money&rdquo; Revolution</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.&rdquo; The method aims to deliver an existing solution at a cheaper cost to first-time consumers or poorer consumers. It typically relies on the use of cost-effective raw materials, standard components and commodities, local production, and local sourcing. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An example of cost innovation is Huawei&rsquo;s ability to sell first-rate smartphones at a cost 20 percent less than Western companies. In 2009, Huawei was also able to beat Ericsson and win a 4G mobile network by providing the same quality and functionality at a lower cost. Similarly, Nokia, in 2006, was able to manufacture and sell a variety of low-cost mobile phones in China. </span></p><h3><b>Good-enough Innovation</b></h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like cost innovation, good-enough product innovation is not a completely new concept. It entails adapting or re-engineering an existing product to meet the specific requirements of customers with limited budgets. In short, good-enough innovation is equivalent to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cost innovation plus feature optimization</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Good-enough innovation also takes advantage of cost-effective raw materials, standard components and commodities, local production, and local sourcing. In addition, it relies on less automation, high robustness, high ease of use, and limitation to core features. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, </span><a href=\"https://www.mt.com/in/en/home.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mettler Toledo</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a Swiss laboratory equipment manufacturer, used the existing weighing scale present in Western markets to create a new, low-cost weighing scale suited to the needs of the Chinese market. The company used cheaper materials, simple design, and low-cost manufacturing, and retained only essential features to keep costs low. Similarly, Logitech created low-cost versions of its products for emerging markets by using low-cost materials, reducing packaging, and removing non-essential features.</span></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19402\" src=\"http://blog.hackerearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Cash-strapped-2.png\" alt=\"Types of innovation on a budget\" width=\"850\" height=\"389\" srcset=\"http://blog.hackerearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Cash-strapped-2.png 850w, http://blog.hackerearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Cash-strapped-2-300x137.png 300w, http://blog.hackerearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Cash-strapped-2-768x351.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px\"/><img/></p><h3><b>Frugal Innovation</b></h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frugal innovations are originally developed products, processes, or applications intended for consumers with low budgets. They are not re-engineered products like good-enough innovations, but have been created from scratch with new features that often disrupt the existing norm. Frugal innovation is also known by other terms such as &ldquo;jugaad&rdquo; or Gandhian innovation to emphasize the Indian context in which such innovations often take place. Frugal innovations are new from both a technological and a market perspective. They often employ an existing technology in a completely new way to access underserved markets.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GE&rsquo;s portable ultrasound device, </span><a href=\"http://www3.gehealthcare.com/en/products/categories/ultrasound/logiq\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Logiq Book</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, developed for rural areas in China in 2002, is a good example of frugal innovation. Although it had reduced functionality as compared to traditional ultrasound devices, its advantage was that doctors could carry it directly to their patients. This helped patients in rural areas access medical help without having to travel to hospitals in far-off places. Thus, GE helped bring ultrasound technology in previously unserved locations with a price reduction of nearly 80 percent. </span></p><h3><b>Reverse Innovation</b></h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the past, innovations would move from the established markets in the West to emerging markets in the East. However, with the rise of global innovation, products are being developed for both established markets as well as emerging markets. Reverse innovation occurs when cost, good-enough, and frugal innovation products are adopted in emerging markets first and then sold in other emerging markets and established markets. Reverse innovations are sometimes called </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">trickle-up</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> innovations as well.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GE&rsquo;s Logiq Book is an example of reverse innovation as well. After its introduction in Chinese rural markets, an advanced version of the product has been developed for Europe and the United States, where new applications have been discovered. Currently, this advanced version is being used in operating rooms and emergency rooms where stationary ultrasound machines do not fit, or in ambulances which use the machine directly at the accident site. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Innovating with minimal resources has become a global phenomenon now, with tools and technologies such as cloud computing, social media, and crowdfunding, smartphones, and 3D printing empowering people to do more with limited budgets. </span></p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://blog.hackerearth.com/how-to-innovate-when-cash-strapped\">How to innovate when you are cash-strapped</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://blog.hackerearth.com\">HackerEarth Blog</a>.</p>"

        "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a long history for both hiring managers and recruiters rejecting &ldquo;job-hoppers&rdquo;. Not only in the past but even today a big proportion of employers (</span><a href=\"https://www.tlnt.com/hiring-job-hoppers-10-reasons-why-they-are-so-very-valuable/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">43%</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) support that they would not consider a job-hopper for their open positions.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For all those who are not familiar with the term, job-hopping is used to describe employees who change job positions every few years. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Millennials change positions for several reasons; what most of the recruiters believe is that they change positions because they are impatient, disloyal and selfish. But, looking at it from a different perspective they may actually be super talented people who are not challenged enough at their current position and are looking for new opportunities which will help them to develop their skills and knowledge. In addition to that, things have changed and the economy is not what it used to be. If our parents&rsquo; generation used to graduate, find a job at a company and then stick to this position for the &ldquo;rest of&rdquo; their career, today, our generation loves to try new experiences and enter new challenges. We have more opportunities and we have completely different preferences than their generation. Despite that, according to </span><a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3055035/you-should-plan-on-switching-jobs-every-three-years-for-the-rest-of-your-\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FastCompany</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, &ldquo;employees who stay with a company longer than two years are said to get paid 50% less&rdquo;. Therefore, millennials have also many other reasons to look for new opportunities more often.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Luckily, the proportion of 43% of the hiring managers and recruiters who still would not consider a job-hopper, in the past used to be even higher. Thus, while time goes and things changes, their opinion changes as well. Nowadays, recruiters focus more on the benefits of hiring a job-hopper may have, instead of focusing on prejudices about their reasons to change job positions.</span></p><ul><li><h2><b>Job-hoppers Are Easily Adaptive</b></h2></li></ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the fact that this category of people changes positions several times every few years, they are expected to be easily adaptive to the new working environment and to the new strategies that the new team needs to follow. They are also likely to be on-boarded quickly. Thus, less time, effort and money on integrating them to the company culture will be required due to the fact that those people have already been changing environments many times and are used to adapt to different organizational cultures.</span></p><ul><li><h2><b>They Are Risk-takers</b></h2></li></ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taking the risk to change positions every few years says a lot! These people are not afraid of trying new things and entering new challenges. They hate staying in the same place for too long and avoid secure roles for eight or ten years. Job-hoppers like jumping into new roles instead. Taking on new responsibilities and swimming to unknown waters is something they enjoy. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Myself, I would prefer to hire someone who loves trying new things and is not afraid of the risks it may have, rather than hiring someone who chases secure roles and is afraid of moving out of his/her zone. The first ones are the people who innovate and bring on the table </span><a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/12/what-is-disruptive-innovation\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">disruptive ideas</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which may shake up the industry, in the future or now.</span></p><ul><li><h2><b>Job-Hoppers Have A Higher Learning Curve And Score Higher Performance</b></h2></li></ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The reason we say that job-hoppers have a higher learning curve is that they are often placed outside of their comfort zone. Being job-hoppers they know that they have to make a great impression and to learn a lot as fast as possible, thus, improving the </span><a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3055035/you-should-plan-on-switching-jobs-every-three-years-for-the-rest-of-your-\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bottom line</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as well. Before moving to their next position they need to convince their current team and employer that they were worth hiring, but at the same time, they put efforts on performing as high as possible aiming to reach positive and valuable records in order to be able to &ldquo;sell&rdquo; their profile to their next employer. As a result, job-hoppers are often over-performers who learn a lot within a very short period of time.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to </span><a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3055035/you-should-plan-on-switching-jobs-every-three-years-for-the-rest-of-your-\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Penelope Trunk</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a serial entrepreneur, and author, the learning curve tends to flatten after three years. Therefore, job-hoppers who are believed to be with the same employer for two or three years, are within the timeline in which they can learn as much as possible and over-perform their goals. They are an opportunity for a company and they can be a great asset.</span></p><ul><li><h2><b>They Bring Knowledge From Your Competitors</b></h2></li></ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A bit more than the half of employers (</span><a href=\"https://www.tlnt.com/hiring-job-hoppers-10-reasons-why-they-are-so-very-valuable/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">53%</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) state that job-hoppers &ldquo;have a wide range of expertise&rdquo;! The truth is that when a job-hopper joins your company, he/she also brings advanced knowledge, best skill and practices, and experience from different companies he/she has been working for. Thus, if they used to work for a company in the same industry as yours, they will bring with them industry knowledge regarding processes or trends you should follow. On the other hand, if they come from a different industry, they can bring knowledge on new practices that could be adapted in your industry. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both scenarios could only have a positive impact on company&rsquo;s performance. They will either help you follow the industry, or they will help you be innovative and introduce new practices and processes into the industry.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All four aforementioned points about job-hoppers, tell us that we should change the way we see millennials who switch jobs very often. We should stop judging them with regards to this action, and instead start focusing on what they could bring to the company. They can be an important asset to the company by bringing new knowledge on processes and practices, by bringing disruptive ideas, and by bringing a bigger network from different companies (within or outside the industry).</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, it is not something easy to accept that after few years these people will be looking for a new company to join. All onboarding and training cost go &ldquo;wasted&rdquo; and this also comes along with other risks such as sharing all knowledge, skills and practices learned in your company, with other companies (and maybe with your competitors as well). But, this is something that sooner or later will happen anyways. There is a moment in life when people feel the need to make a change in their life and/or career. Therefore, considering and evaluating all advantages and disadvantages of hiring a job-hopper, it seems to be beneficial for a company to have someone who changes roles very often. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To avoid thinking in the same way we used to think a few years ago when recruiting, we should focus more on the skills someone can bring on the table, as well as on personality and how this person would fit with the company culture. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From a different point of view, someone could also say that switching positions every few years shows a lot about the personality and could be related to their unstable behavior or to their inability to decide what they really like. But, as stated above, along with this disadvantage, hiring a job-hopper comes with a lot of advantages as well. Therefore, I believe that these advantages and disadvantages should be evaluated in each specific situation, and only after considering each specific case, a decision should be made about hiring or not a job-hopper. Important is to be open-minded and to not make </span><a href=\"http://blog.hackerearth.com/types-bias-avoid-recruitment-process\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bias</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> decisions while screening a Resume. &ldquo;Going blind&rdquo; during the first screening is an option, and using a </span><a href=\"http://blog.hackerearth.com/five-reasons-use-talent-assessment-tool\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">talent assessment tool</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> before interviewing someone is another option. It provides you with the opportunity to make a decision based on analytics and evaluation, instead of letting your prejudices to impact your decision.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check some statistics about job-hoppers below:</span></p><p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: </span></i><a href=\"https://www.careerbuilder.com/share/aboutus/pressreleasesdetail.aspx?sd=5%2F15%2F2014&amp;id=pr824&amp;ed=12%2F31%2F2014\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CareerBuilder</span></i></a></p><h2><b>Job-hopping by Industry</b></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Information Technology, an industry with a notable talent shortage and highly competitive recruitment tactics, has the largest percentage of employers who expect workers to job-hop. Rounding out the top five industries are:</span></p><ul><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Information Technology &ndash; 42 percent</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leisure &amp; Hospitality &ndash; 41 percent</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transportation &ndash; 37 percent</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Retail &ndash; 36 percent</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manufacturing &ndash; 32 percent</span></li></ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*The study shows that a significant number of employers (43 percent) will not consider a candidate who has had short tenures with several employers. However, others point to advantages in hiring people who have worked for numerous companies. More than half (53 percent) of employers said job-hoppers tend to have a wide range of expertise and can adapt quickly (51 percent).</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The majority of employers (55 percent) said that they have hired someone they would categorize as a job-hopper. Of those employers:</span></p><ul><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">34 percent said the job-hopper left after a short period of time</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">40 percent said the job-hopper stayed for at least two years</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">17 percent said the job-hopper stayed for at least three years</span></li></ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To conclude, the way we perceive job-hoppers has changed over years and recruiters are not being anymore very strict. Recruiters are being open-minded and they are turning their focus toward the many positive things a job-hopper could bring to a company.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>(1) Right now there are constraints that are shipped with a data type that wraps them:</p><ul><li><code>~</code> comes with <code>:~:</code> (<code>Refl</code>)</li><li><code>~~</code> comes with <code>:~~:</code> (<code>HRefl</code>)</li><li><code>Coercible</code> comes with <code>Coercion</code></li></ul><p>This is clearly code duplication. The need arises because we need to manipulate these constraints manually, store their evidence in data structures, etc.</p><p>For constraints that don't ship with a dedicated data type to represent them, there's the <code>Dict</code> wrapper from the <code>constraints</code> package to achieve the same. One issue with it is that it creates a boxed value, so <code>Dict (C a)</code> is one more pointer indirection than a dictionary for <code>C a</code> itself.</p><p>(2) Right now there is no way to treat data types as constraints. We have the <code>reflection</code> library that gives us two styles to achieve it:</p><ul><li><code>Given</code> for incoherent (unsafe) reflection</li><li><code>Reifies</code> for regular reflection</li></ul><p>The implementations of <code>Given</code> and <code>Reifies</code> rely crucially on <code>unsafeCoerce</code>, and two assumptions:</p><ul><li>classes with a single method are represented as newtypes in Core</li><li><code>=></code> and <code>-></code> are the same in Core</li></ul><p>There is a <a href=\"https://github.com/treeowl/ghc-proposals/blob/magic-reflection/proposals/0000-magic-reflection.rst\">proposal</a> to make GHC support reflection natively, but in its current form it requires a questionable use of <code>Symbol</code> to generate a data family constructor in a <code>deriving</code> declaration (this would be the first precedent where <code>deriving</code> takes up namespace).</p><p>We also have a similar situation for singleton types, because it is desirable to pass them implicitly:</p><ul><li><code>TypeRep</code> is passed via <code>Typeable</code></li><li><code>Sing</code> is passed via <code>SingI</code></li></ul><p>(3) The interactions between <code>Type</code> and <code>Constraint</code> are awkward as hell. They are the same in Core, but not in surface Haskell (more context in <a href=\"https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/11715\">Trac #11715</a> and the GHC <a href=\"https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/rae/constraint-vs-type/proposals/0000-constraint-vs-type.rst\">proposal</a>). Additionally, we have <code>()</code> and <code>(,)</code> that belong to both kinds (sort of, there's TDNR at play here) but are not kind-polymorphic, and <code>(,)</code> cannot be partially applied in constraints (more info in <a href=\"https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/UnliftedDataTypes#ProposalB2.Morelevitypolymorphism\">GHC wiki</a>, see <code>Constraintiness</code>).</p><p>(4) Classes largely overlap with records in functionality. We know that it's possible to encode any type class as a record and pass it explicitly (see <a href=\"http://www.haskellforall.com/2012/05/scrap-your-type-classes.html\">Scrap your type classes </a>). The reason we don't do this is because type class dictionaries are (a) guaranteed to be coherent (unless we use orphans or <code>-XIncoherentInstances</code>) and (b) are passed implicitly, which is convenient, especially when it comes to accessing superclasses.</p><p>(5) Creating synonyms for classes is painful. We have to write the following code:</p><pre><code>type Alias' a b c = (Foo a, Bar b, Baz, Quux, Tux c) class Alias' a b c => Alias a b c instance Alias' a b c => Alias a b c </code></pre><p>We cannot use the constraint synonym directly because it cannot be partially applied, and for a good reason: we want aliases to be nominally different to allow partial application. For types of kind <code>*</code> we have both <code>type</code> and <code>newtype</code>, but for constraints we have only <code>type</code> (and we have to simulate <code>newtype</code> with the trick above).</p><hr/><hr/><p>The above issues are interconnected. We have two similar features &mdash; classes and record types. But each has its downsides:</p><ul><li>data types: no control over coherence/implicit passing, no associated type families or functional dependencies</li><li>classes: no ability to manipulate the dictionary (construct it, pass it around) or even refer to its name, no newtypes</li></ul><p>I think that we should zoom out, take a look at all of these issues at once, and design a solution that would unify classes and data types in a new notion that would support fine-grained control over coherence and implicit passing. The ideal outcome of this thread would be a GHC proposal to address all of these shortcomings.</p></div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/int_index\"> /u/int_index </a><br/><span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/7m4oz6/haskell_needs_a_better_story_for_constraints/\">[link]</a></span><span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/7m4oz6/haskell_needs_a_better_story_for_constraints/\">[comments]</a></span>"

As a group of second year college students with a growing portfolio of work, my team and I wanted to find out. So we signed up to a hackathon.</p><p name=\"9912\" id=\"9912\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It was a Financial Technology (or &lsquo;Fintech&rsquo;)<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\"></em>hackathon organized by DCB Bank in the city of Mumbai. Although we were clueless about Fintech, we wanted to give it a try, in the hope of coming with an idea that solves a general problem.</p><p name=\"cdd3\" id=\"cdd3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The event was hosted in the beautiful and cozy co-working space by <a href=\"http://www.91springboard.com/\" data-href=\"http://www.91springboard.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">91 Springboard</a>. This was an environment I hadn&rsquo;t been in before.</p><p name=\"7a87\" id=\"7a87\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Basically, it rents out office space for startups, freelancers and such who don&rsquo;t need a huge office, but just a workspace for their team members to collaborate. 91 Springboard takes care of providing fun colorful and snug workspaces, fast internet and <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">unlimited coffee</strong>, while you work hassle-free. It was really a pleasure crashing here for the weekend.</p><figure name=\"1af2\" id=\"1af2\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 1244px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 177.8%;\"></div><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*ktaiKAGjPtHFjrcBnH__GQ.jpeg\" data-width=\"720\" data-height=\"1280\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*ktaiKAGjPtHFjrcBnH__GQ.jpeg\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*ktaiKAGjPtHFjrcBnH__GQ.jpeg\"/></div></figure><h3 name=\"5936\" id=\"5936\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure\">The Idea</h3><blockquote name=\"6f48\" id=\"6f48\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--h3\">To put it simply, we wanted to build a specialized chatbot.</blockquote><p name=\"9807\" id=\"9807\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Why?</strong></p><p name=\"8c0f\" id=\"8c0f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It&rsquo;s predicted by 2020, a huge percent of business communication will be done through chatbots.</p><p name=\"ed21\" id=\"ed21\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">User experience (&lsquo;UX&rsquo;) is rapidly changing. With messaging apps gaining popularity, users prefer to access everything under one app. They are also in favor of one-on-one communication.</p><p name=\"451e\" id=\"451e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Gone are the days of emails, it&rsquo;s all about real-time chat now. With today&rsquo;s technology, it&rsquo;s possible to create a chat-bot which can learn by itself and automate most of the tasks, allowing mass communication on an individual level.</p><p name=\"65aa\" id=\"65aa\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">See <a href=\"https://medium.com/the-mission/11-best-uses-of-chatbots-right-now-1c27764b7e62\" data-href=\"https://medium.com/the-mission/11-best-uses-of-chatbots-right-now-1c27764b7e62\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\">here for a list</a> of some of the<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"></strong>best uses of chatbots right now<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">.</strong></p><h3 name=\"07f8\" id=\"07f8\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h3-strong\">What exactly did we&nbsp;build?</strong></h3><p name=\"9635\" id=\"9635\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">As we were at a Fintech hackathon, we thought about a bot that carries out all the functions that can be carried out by the bank&rsquo;s app and more&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;through chat.</p><p name=\"cc58\" id=\"cc58\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Once logged in, you can ask the bot for your balance, your last few transactions, and also to carry out actions such as fund transfers. It leverages the required APIs provided by the bank for the same purposes.</p><figure name=\"4f33\" id=\"4f33\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 635px; max-height: 525px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 82.69999999999999%;\"></div><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*4w1aKz7kinC_f4x895Q4mQ.png\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"525\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*4w1aKz7kinC_f4x895Q4mQ.png\"/></div></figure><p name=\"89c8\" id=\"89c8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Above is a screenshot of some of our UX inspiration. This UX had a combination of natural language and multiple options, which were directly provided as links and buttons. The flow of answering users queries, suggesting the next steps and also allowing actions to be carried out, was planned.</p><h3 name=\"c8a7\" id=\"c8a7\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">The Project</h3><figure name=\"f501\" id=\"f501\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--h3\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 376px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 53.800000000000004%;\"></div><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*R8skObeTKbyqwD0zrWnEgw.png\" data-width=\"1244\" data-height=\"669\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*R8skObeTKbyqwD0zrWnEgw.png\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*R8skObeTKbyqwD0zrWnEgw.png\"/></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">The final&nbsp;product</figcaption></figure><p name=\"4d1b\" id=\"4d1b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">The tech stack we chose was Ruby on Rails. We picked this because my teammates were very familiar with it, and I was focusing on wrapping up APIs and UI primarily. But this stack was totally new to me, as I&rsquo;ve always worked on JavaScript or Python stacks. I wrote about my learning journey <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/ruby-on-rails-and-full-stack-javascript-ecadf631707\" data-href=\"https://hackernoon.com/ruby-on-rails-and-full-stack-javascript-ecadf631707\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p><p name=\"377d\" id=\"377d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It uses a basic PostgreSQL database to store user messages, and uses ActionCable for live data-streaming as required. The whole site (along with the chat as a widget) is built over the Materialize framework.</p><p name=\"e18a\" id=\"e18a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">One of the key features we planned to use was a customized AI, rather than going for something like IBM Watson or api.ai. This was wrapped into an API using Flask.</p><figure name=\"9662\" id=\"9662\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 236px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 33.7%;\"></div><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*vujT5aZnb1ynwVgpM8lqug.png\" data-width=\"769\" data-height=\"259\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*vujT5aZnb1ynwVgpM8lqug.png\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*vujT5aZnb1ynwVgpM8lqug.png\"/></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Intent mapping</figcaption></figure><p name=\"73c7\" id=\"73c7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Initially, when the bot has little to no training data, human assistance is required to give responses and also classify the intent of each user query for the bot to learn. Once it accumulates data, it can automate the whole process, giving appropriate responses.</p><p name=\"c3c0\" id=\"c3c0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">A few of the scripts used for the AI are available <a href=\"https://github.com/dhanushkamath/DCBHackathonScripts\" data-href=\"https://github.com/dhanushkamath/DCBHackathonScripts\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p><h3 name=\"43e7\" id=\"43e7\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">The Hackathon</h3><p name=\"27f9\" id=\"27f9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">We managed four hours of sleep over a span of more than 30 hours, while pushing over 50,000 lines of code to production.</p><p name=\"18bf\" id=\"18bf\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But it wasn&rsquo;t as bad as it sounds! The place itself has this motivating vibe, and there are mentors helping you out. There were breaks in between to chill with other teams and getting to know other kick-ass developers.</p><p name=\"2c43\" id=\"2c43\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">While my team mates focused on the Machine Learning part and the actual chat application on Rails, I worked on the UI for the service. This included an admin panel as well as the chat widget. Quite a lot of time was spent wrapping up the AI code into RESTful APIs and fixing bugs in the main code as well.</p><p name=\"cc21\" id=\"cc21\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In the end, what we had was a basic alpha version of the app we set out to build.</p><figure name=\"2575\" id=\"2575\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 1244px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 177.8%;\"></div><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*zjjvbbFaAJjb3CyLMD8cSA.jpeg\" data-width=\"720\" data-height=\"1280\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*zjjvbbFaAJjb3CyLMD8cSA.jpeg\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*zjjvbbFaAJjb3CyLMD8cSA.jpeg\"/></div></figure><h3 name=\"f6e4\" id=\"f6e4\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure\">The Experience</h3><blockquote name=\"e302\" id=\"e302\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--h3\">For a start, this was the most productive 30 hours of my life.</blockquote><p name=\"82f5\" id=\"82f5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">With constant bursts of motivation (and caffeine) driving me, there was no time for sitting around or lazing. Loads of fun and talented people to interact with as well, because I was one of the youngest there.</p><p name=\"f7f2\" id=\"f7f2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">A few of the things I learned here included:</p><ul class=\"postList\"><li name=\"d2b2\" id=\"d2b2\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">Decoupled application architecture</li><li name=\"cb3c\" id=\"cb3c\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Building an app from scratch and then pushing into deployment in the shortest time possible</li><li name=\"4c85\" id=\"4c85\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Live code collaboration</li><li name=\"a54a\" id=\"a54a\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">and of course, a little bit of Fintech!</li></ul><p name=\"02b9\" id=\"02b9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">Check out the project we worked on here:<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\"></em><a href=\"http://chaturbots.com/\" data-href=\"http://chaturbots.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">chaturbots.com</a>.

            "description": "<p>It seems to be a recurring discussion in the companies I have worked for: should we use a codename for this project or not?  These are software projects.  The codenames are used on things as basic as the repository name or slack channel.  Later, they might be used in many other project-related things like the build server configuration.  The alternative for a codename is calling the thing exactly what it is.  Where’s the fun in that?</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/gpqydff.jpg\" alt=\"project codenames\"></p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n\n<h2>The Argument Against Codenames</h2>\n\n<p>The argument is that if you call the project what it is, people will know what you’re referring to when you talk about it or when you see it in your version control or on the build server or hear about it at lunch.</p>\n\n<h2>It’s Fun</h2>\n\n<p>I think codenames are fun.  They add identity and character to your project.  They contribute to team spirit.  You have marketing options in a codename via logos, mascots, and themes.  Most things you can do to increase the cohesiveness of a team around a shared identity, sense of belonging, and to increase their enthusiasm will be worth it.  Why not let codenames help you with this?</p>\n\n<p>An environment where codenames are enjoyed is one that is <em>not</em> sterile and colorless.  There are people and product markets that specifically enjoy things and places that are not organized in clean, labelled boxes.  Bring some color to your environment, learn to stop worrying, and love having fun together.</p>\n\n<h2>They Encourage Learning</h2>\n\n<p>When you hear a codename for the first time, you might not know what it means.  Is that an unusual or bad thing?  Not knowing what it means should encourage you to ask what it means or look it up.</p>\n\n<p>After you do, you’ll then have learned it.  You’ll have connected with people that know about it.  You’ll have found the documentation detailing what it <em>really</em> is, not just what you can fit into a name.  I like the idea of each project having a root readme file that describes the core ‘What’ and ‘Why’ of the project.</p>\n\n<h2>They’re Short</h2>\n\n<p>Codenames are usually shorter than any presumably more descriptive name.  This is great because we usually are talking about our projects or teams <em>all</em> the time.  Thus something long and descriptive, like a bloated government agency name, is likely to be shortened into an acronym instead (which is just a codename constrained by odd letter combinations).  Worse still, as people tire of saying the longer name, they start making up their own easier-to-get-out versions which will not be consistent.</p>\n\n<h2>We Speak a Specialized Language With Each Other</h2>\n\n<p>Codenames are great for the usually-specialized teams that end up working together.  These teams speak a common language that they learn because of the domain they all work in together.  It’s a specialized language.  This is common for other technical and specialized groups: For example, air traffic controllers speaking to pilots on the radio will use terse, specific terms that others outside the domain don’t necessarily recognize but which the two parties have learned to use together.  If your teams are cross-functional, you should learn the lingo common to your domain.</p>\n\n<h2>They Need Discoverability Help</h2>\n\n<p>Codenames do not help with discoverability.  In the age of search, however, this point is lessened.  We often put important domain-related keywords next to content.  I’m all for including bylines next to codenames as a one-line explanation of what it is.  Using a combo like this when it makes sense will give you the best of both words: exact consistency via the codename and some discoverable verbiage via an accompanying byline.</p>\n\n<h2>They’re New Words</h2>\n\n<p>A codename a variable name.  It’s an abstraction.  It represents a project, team, codebase, or something else.  It hides the internals.  It will outlive your company’s pivot from the original project scope and meaning so you can keep your codename even as your mission changes.  It usually doesn’t leak the internal implementation details.</p>\n\n<p>Codenames are singletons within the universe of your company.  No one else will have the same team name, repo name, or slack channel.  Codenames are the keys in the dictionary of values.</p>\n\n<p>After you learn a codename once, when it’s mentioned, you’ll know what it is.  Nbd.</p>\n\n<h2>They’re All Around Us</h2>\n\n<p>Codenames are all around us, thankfully.  Who really wants to call Kleenex, “facial tissue”, anyway?</p>\n\n<p>You’ve heard of Python, React, maybe even <a href=\"https://github.com/Netflix/SimianArmy/wiki/Chaos-Monkey\">Chaos Monkey</a> (and check it out, they even have a ‘What’ and ‘Why’ in their readme!).  You’ve probably also heard of Microsoft SQL Server.  Blegh.  Doesn’t that fill your soul with the emptiness of corporate sterility.  Though, there are codenames in their too, right?  “Microsoft”.  “SQL” (one of those weird descriptive-things-turned-acronym).</p>\n\n<p>So, embrace codenames.  You use them anyway.  It’ll be more fun for most.  It’ll bring color to your world.  It’ll bring life and character to your team identity and the discussions you have about what you do.</p>\n\n<p>What are some of your favorite codenames, and what are some of your favorite reasons for using them?</p>",

            "description": "<p>JavaScript’s Function object has a very helpful method, <code>bind</code>.  It is a great tool to give you control of the ever-squirrely <code>this</code> keyword.  Have you ever had trouble predicting what <code>this</code> will be or making equate to what you want?  <code>bind</code> will help you do that with more power and consistency.  It can also help you with partial function application.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/4huM3Xb.jpg\" alt=\"function bind\"></p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n\n<h2>The <code>this</code> Keyword</h2>\n\n<p>In JavaScript, what the <code>this</code> keyword refers to changes often.  This can be useful but also unexpected.  Generally <code>this</code>, used within a function, will refer to the context in which that function was called. That calling context might be the global context of <code>window</code> if an event callback is being called in a browser.  That calling context might be an object that contains the function.  For more specific cases, MDN has some <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this\">great docs on the variety of contexts referred to by <code>this</code></a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Controlling <code>this</code> with <code>bind</code></h2>\n\n<p>When writing code, I often am thinking of <code>this</code> in the context in which I’m writing.  In other words, if I’m writing an object and use the keyword <code>this</code> in a function, I would normally expect <code>this</code> to refer to the object in which I <em>declared</em> the function.  But, again, it is actually the <em>calling</em> context that actually determines the value of <code>this</code>.</p>\n\n<p>To change this default behavior, I can pre-bind the function’s value of <code>this</code> to a value of my choosing.  This will happen at the time of <em>declaration</em>, which is what I more naturally would expect.</p>\n\n<p>For example, in <a href=\"http://facebook.github.io/react/\">React</a> we write UI components.  In interesting UIs, we’re often handling events like those that occur with user interaction.  Normally events in the browser are attached to the DOM and are executed in the context of the <code>window</code>.  This being the case, it’ll be hard for us to create an event handler function in our React Component that can refer back to anything of use in the React Component itself.</p>\n\n<p>As a simple example, we’ll write a <code>handleClick</code> function that wants to call the Component’s <code>doLog</code> function for interesting logging:</p>\n\n<figure

href=\"http://jsbin.com/lixayanoso/edit?js,console,output\">jsbin of broken state</a></p>\n\n<p>If you click the button, <code>this.doLog</code> is not available as a function.  How could it be?  <code>doLog</code> is defined in <code>MyComponent</code>, not the <code>window</code>, which is the original context in which the event callback is executed.</p>\n\n<p>To fix this, one need only pre-bind the <code>handleClick</code> function.  By changing one line, we can fix this:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"code\"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tbody><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class=\"line-number\">1</span>\n</pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><code class=\"js\"><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nx\">button</span> <span class=\"nx\">onClick</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"k\">this</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">handleClick</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">bind</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\">this</span><span class=\"p\">)}</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span><span class=\"nx\">So</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">click</span><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"err\">/button&gt;</span>\n</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>\n\n\n<p>When this line is executed, it’s in the <code>MyComponent#render</code> function, thus the <code>MyComponent</code> context.  So <code>this</code>, at that moment, is <code>MyComponent</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The other detail that makes this work is that <code>bind</code> returns a <em>brand new function</em>.  That’s how the pre-binding works.  So, the <code>onClick</code> prop that gets given to the <code>button</code> is a new function where we have said we want to permanently control the value of <code>this</code> to be whatever we bound it to.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://jsbin.com/luwoxegopu/edit?js,console,output\">jsbin of fixed state</a></p>\n\n<h2>Passing Specific Arguments with <code>bind</code></h2>\n\n<p>Another great reason to use <code>bind</code> is to pass specific arguments to a function.  Just as <code>bind</code> can create new functions where the value of <code>this</code> is pre-determined (bound), <code>bind</code> can pre-fill (ie, partially apply) function arguments on the newly-created function.</p>\n\n<p>It may not be immediately intuitive why one would want to create a function with parameters just to turn around and permanently make it so an argument to the function equals a specific value.  It almost feels like hard-coding a wart-ridden value on something that was previously dynamic and beautiful.  Perhaps an example will help.</p>\n\n<p>Again, to the world of React…  As in the previous example, we’ll pass an event handler for a click event.  Notice, just as above, that we’re passing the function itself (<code>this.handleClick</code> above) instead of the return value of the function (which would look like <code>this.handleClick()</code>).  In this example, we’ll have several click handlers, each on a list item, where the button will function as a remove button:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"code\"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div

            "description": "<p>React allows you to create components that will render UI for your application.  If your UI is of any complexity, you’ll likely want to test that it functions correctly and allows for future refactors.  There are numerous ways to do this.  One way that you might appreciate is using <a href=\"https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom\">jsdom</a>, an in-JavaScript implementation of the DOM.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/DXuSNbw.png\" alt=\"react on jsdom\"></p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n\n<h2>What is jsdom?</h2>\n\n<p>Jsdom is an in-JavaScript implementation of the DOM.  The DOM is the document object model, which is the tree of nodes that make up the UI for documents shown in web browsers.</p>\n\n<p>Because jsdom is implemented in JavaScript, we can have a DOM-like API to work with without needing a browser.  That means that we don’t have to capture a browser in order test, a la <a href=\"http://karma-runner.github.io/\">Karma</a>.  That means that we can run our tests in environments without browsers, like in Node or in continuous integration environments.</p>\n\n<p>By not using real browsers, we’re also essentially saying that we believe the problems in our client JavaScript will not be browser-dependent (again, because we’re not capturing <em>real</em> browsers).</p>\n\n<h2>jsdom Requirements</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom\">latest version of jsdom</a>, as of this writing, requires <a href=\"https://iojs.org/en/index.html\">io.js</a> instead of Node to run.  If you’d like to run in Node.js instead, the <a href=\"https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/tree/3.x\">3.x series of jsdom</a> is required.</p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"http://thenextweb.com/dd/2015/06/16/node-js-and-io-js-are-settling-their-differences-merging-back-together/\">Node and io.js merge in the future</a>, I expect the new versions of jsdom to support the one, unified platform.</p>\n\n<h2>The Test Runner</h2>\n\n<p>In my JavaScript tests, I prefer to use the <a href=\"http://mochajs.org/\">Mocha</a> test runner.  It’s usable in Node or browser environments.  It has great async test support.  It has the familiar behavior-style syntax of <code>describe</code> and <code>it</code> and all the normal test setup hooks that you like.  Most importantly, it features the Nyan cat test reporter:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://mochajs.org/images/reporter-nyan.png\" alt=\"nyan cat test reporter\"></p>\n\n<p>Mocha lets you choose your own assertion library.  I like <a href=\"http://shouldjs.github.io/\">should.js</a>.</p>\n\n<p>To install both:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"code\"><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tbody><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class=\"line-number\">1</span>\n</pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><code class=\"\"><span class=\"line\">npm install mocha should --save-dev</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>\n\n\n<h2>Configuring Mocha</h2>\n\n<p>By default, Mocha wants a <code>/test</code> directory in your project root in which to put its configuration and potentially your spec files, depending on how you like to organize your projects:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"code\"><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tbody><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class=\"line-number\">1</span>\n</pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><code class=\"\"><span class=\"line\">mkdir test</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>\n\n\n<p>Inside of the <code>/test</code> dir, let’s <code>vim mocha.opts</code> and give it a place to configure jsdom and our other libs:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"code\"><figcaption><span>mocha.opts</span></figcaption><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tbody><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class=\"line-number\">1</span>\n<span class=\"line-number\">2</span>\n<span class=\"line-number\">3</span>\n</pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><code class=\"text\"><span class=\"line\">--require test/utils/dom.js\n</span><span class=\"line\">--require should\n</span><span class=\"line\">--reporter nyan\n</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>\n\n\n<p>We have yet to write the <code>test/utils/dom.js</code> file.  We will.  This file includes options for mocha.  Line by line, we’re saying that before mocha runs tests, we want to load our <code>dom.js</code> config, the <code>should.js</code> library, and specify our reporter as <code>nyan</code>.</p>\n\n<h2>Configuring jsdom</h2>\n\n<p>I’ve tried to come up with several configurations that will make jsdom work well with my React projects.  This is the best/simplest that I’ve come up with.  I’d be interested to hear if you have any suggestions on the approach.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s the full configuration with explanatory comments inline, as it would appear in <code>test/utils/dom.js</code>:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"code\"><figcaption><span>dom.js</span></figcaption><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tbody><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre

            "description": "<p>On November 25 at 4:30 AM, our consumer apps stopped working because of some issue with our backend API. This article is a postmortem of what happened that night.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"somebackground\">Some Background</h2>\n\n<p>Our product search and navigation is served from Elasticsearch. We create daily index of products, related merchant data and locality data in one index but under different mappings. This index is built on a daily basis and then the latest index is switched with an existing one under a fixed alias. This works well.</p>\n\n<p>Most of our requests are geolocation dependent, which is the reason why we are so heavily dependent on Elasticsearch.</p>\n\n<p>The current state of our systems is that we have an API (called Consumer API) which serves product data curated using another system called Content Management System (CMS). CMS is the system which we use for curating our catalog and other content that changes frequently (on a day-to-day basis or multiple times a day) and is published to our consumer app. The responsibility of curating this data using CMS is of our Content Team.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"theincident\">The Incident</h2>\n\n<p>A couple of weeks back, our consumer mobile apps stopped working because our Consumer API was sending 500 response for every request that depends on Elasticsearch. This happened at around 4:30 AM in the morning when obviously nobody from our engineering team was awake.</p>\n\n<p>We had not pushed any code changes at this time so we were sure that there is no bug in the code querying Elasticsearch. On the basis of that and the exceptions thrown by Elasticsearch (<code>java.lang.NumberFormatException</code>), we deduced that something was wrong with the Elasticsearch index.</p>\n\n<p>We re-build our indexes daily and thankfully keep the old ones for situations like such. Within minutes, we switched the search alias to use the older index and our app was working normally again, although serving stale data.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"postmortem\">Postmortem</h2>\n\n<p>While our service was working normally again, we could not continue to serve stale data as we had switched to an old index.</p>\n\n<p>Logs helped us figure out the failing queries. We used <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sense-beta/lhjgkmllcaadmopgmanpapmpjgmfcfig?hl=en\">Sense</a> and started playing around with those queries manually on the faulty index. The same queries were running fine on older indices. As mentioned earlier, we were seeing the following exception:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sort[&lt;custom:\\\"price\\\": org.elasticsearch.index.fielddata.fieldcomparator.LongValuesComparatorSource@60d18f72&gt;]: Query Failed [Failed to execute main query]]; nested: ElasticsearchException[java.lang.NumberFormatException: Invalid shift value (64) in prefixCoded bytes (is encoded value really an INT?)]  \n</code></pre>\n\n<h3 id=\"whatchanged\">What changed?</h3>\n\n<p>For the upcoming sale, our business functions behind the campaign wanted to run promotions on our app. To make the promotions related content controllable via the CMS, our engineering team worked towards adding certain features which allowed our Content Team to manage promotions that are shown in the app. This feature also implemented making promotions available for querying using Elasticsearch since promotions are also location specific.</p>\n\n<p>To add promotions in the same Elasticsearch, the CMS team decided to add a new doctype/mapping in Elasticsearch called <code>promotions</code>. The feature was tested locally by the developer and it worked fine. No issues were caught anywhere during testing and the code was pushed to production.</p>\n\n<p>The feature came into use when our content team started curating the content past midnight for the sale starting the next day. Once they added the content and started the re-indexing procedure (which is a manual button click), our consumer app stopped working. As soon as the team started indexing the content around 4:30 AM, our app stopped working. Our search queries started returning <code>NumberFormatException</code> on our price field.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"understandingelasticsearchbetter\">Understanding Elasticsearch Better</h2>\n\n<p>With Elasticsearch things may seem very nice and simple from the outside. In reality, they may not be as nice and simple. One of the nice things that Elasticsearch has, you may say, is being schema-less and using JSON for storing documents. JSON by its very nature is very flexible to work with. Add or remove things as you please. And Elasticsearch would take care of the rest. But that's what most of us beginning with Elasticsearch believe to be true. The reality is quite different.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Elasticsearch is NOT schema-less</strong>. It just appears schema-less by assuming schema at the time of indexing a document. According to the official <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/mapping-intro.html#core-fields\">Elasticsearch Definitive guide</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When you index a document that contains a new field—one previously not seen—Elasticsearch will use dynamic mapping to try to guess the field type from the basic datatypes available in JSON, using the following rules:</p>\n  \n  <table>\n  <tbody><tr style=\"font-weight:bold; border-bottom: #edece4 .25em solid;\">  \n  <td>JSON Type</td>  \n  <td>Field Type</td>  \n  </tr>  \n  <tr>  \n  <td>Boolean: <code>true</code> or <code>false</code></td>  \n  <td><code>boolean</code></td>  \n  </tr>  \n  <tr>  \n  <td>Whole number: <code>123</code></td>  \n  <td><code>long</code></td>  \n  </tr>  \n  <tr>  \n  <td>Floating point: <code>123.45</code></td>  \n  <td><code>double</code></td>  \n  </tr>  \n  <tr>  \n  <td>String, valid date: <code>\"2014-09-15\"</code></td>  \n  <td><code>date</code></td>  \n  </tr>  \n  <tr>  \n  <td>String: <code>\"foo bar\"</code></td>  \n  <td><code>string</code></td>  \n  </tr>  \n  </tbody></table>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3 id=\"howelasticsearchreallyhandlesmappings\">How Elasticsearch really handles mappings</h3>\n\n<p>An Elasticsearch index is made of one or more shards. An index is nothing but a collection of shards. Practically speaking, one index with 5 shards or 5 indices with one shard each are essentially the same.</p>\n\n<p>The documents are stored in shards. Shards are made up of <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/2705123/1060344\">Lucene Segments</a>. Whenever you index a new document in Elasticsearch, it is first written in the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/found-elasticsearch-from-the-bottom-up#translog\">transaction log (in-memory and file)</a>. After a fixed period of time (the <code>refresh_interval</code>), the documents from the transaction log are picked up and written to a Lucene Segment file. Lucene Segments are immutable which means that once written, they cannot be modified. Lucene Segments have the actual indexes that are used for performing searches. When you execute a search query, Elasticsearch opens the right segment files and uses them for getting the matching documents.</p>\n\n<p>It is also important to understand how mappings/doctypes work in Elasticsearch. As mentioned earlier, Elasticsearch is not schema-less. It is just good at assuming schemas. Schemas can be defined as mappings in Elasticsearch. Mappings are the way to define the structure of a document and how the data of a document is stored at Lucene level.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lucene Segments are not type-aware</strong>. Lucene Segments, basically, just store key-value pairs where keys are fields and values are lists of any kind of value that may be used in the search process. To quote the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/mapping.html#_how_lucene_sees_documents\">Elasticsearch guide</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A document in Lucene consists of a simple list of field-value pairs. A field must have at least one value, but any field can contain multiple values. Similarly, a single string value may be converted into multiple values by the analysis process. Lucene doesn’t care if the values are strings or numbers or dates—all values are just treated as opaque bytes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Since all the inverted indices in an Elasticsearch index (don't get confused) are stored in segment files, it does not really matter if you have two different mappings with the same field names but with different types. The values for field <code>price</code> in <code>products</code> mapping and the values for field <code>price</code> in <code>promotions</code> mapping (in the same index) will essentially be added to the same list at Lucene Segment level. And it will not fail or throw an exception.</p>\n\n<p>This introduces unexpected problems which can be difficult to deal with if you have not experienced this before yourself or not read the docs properly. In our case, this is precisely what happened. Our existing mappings were set by us where we had used <code>integer</code> type for <code>price</code> field in <code>products</code> mapping. When <code>promotions</code> mapping was added, we did not care to define the mapping and depended on Elasticsearch to take care of it. Elasticsearch did what it usually does - assumed the value to be <code>long</code> and went ahead and set the mapping to have <code>long</code> type for <code>price</code> field.</p>\n\n<p>We were sorting on the <code>price</code> field in our queries from the consumer app. At some level because of this mess up, Elasticsearch failed to give expected results. How this is explained in Elasticsearch is that Elasticsearch is based around field data. So when all the field data is loaded in the memory, Elasticsearch will either see them as <code>long</code> or <code>integer</code> depending upon whatever it saw first. In our case, Elasticsearch probably fail to load <code>long</code> values in memory since it saw <code>integer</code> values first.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"howwefixedit\">How we fixed it</h3>\n\n<p>As I mentioned, we had immediately switched back to previous day's index but that was just a quick interim fix. We had new data that we had to show to our consumers for the sale that was about to start in about 6 hours from the time of failure.</p>\n\n<p>We first thought of re-indexing the entire index. However, our ETL process as of now takes about 8 hours as we had not worked on optimizing it and in a situation like this we could not even do much with it immediately. And if we started the re-indexing process, it would take so much time that it would not be done before the start of our sale.</p>\n\n<p>We understood that we needed to delete the new <code>promotions</code> mapping somehow, set the correct mapping to ensure that <code>price</code> has <code>integer</code> type and re-index the promotions data which would be very quick as data size was extremely small. So we started with that. We deleted the mapping using the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/1.4/indices-delete-mapping.html\">Delete Mapping API</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The documents got deleted and were not searchable any more. We hoped that this would work. But it didn't. Why? Go back to the fundamentals about Lucene Segments we discussed earlier - they are immutable. Deleting never really deletes documents and field data from segment files. Documents are just marked as deleted.</p>\n\n<p>The actual deletion happens when segments are merged. Segments are merged so that we don't end up with too many segment files on disk (<a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/merge-process.html\">read why</a>). So background threads in Elasticsearch pick up existing segment files and merge them and garbage is collected in the merging process, meaning that deleted documents are actually deleted.</p>\n\n<p>We could not wait for this to happen in the background as we were short on time and had to make sure that things were actually fine or come up with an alternative solution. Thankfully, Elasticsearch has <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-optimize.html\">Optimize API</a> which triggers segment merging.</p>\n\n<p>We triggered optimization using this API. When the API succeeded, we hoped that things would work. But they didn't. This time around the issue was that Elasticsearch's Optimize API decides for itself how segments are going to be merged and if all segments will get merged or not. The only logical explanation we could make was that there were still segments lying around with invalid price values with them and did not get garbage collected.</p>\n\n<p>It would have been nice if there was a way to merge all the segments. Thankfully, Optimize API has a parameter called <code>max_num_segments</code> which allows you to specify how many segments would you want after the optimization process has run. We set that to <code>1</code> and triggered optimization again. And... voila! We had everything working again.</p>\n\n<p>We went ahead and defined the mapping properly for <code>promotions</code>, re-indexed promotion data quickly and had a peaceful sale for the next three days.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"howcouldwehaveavoidedthis\">How could we have avoided this?</h3>\n\n<h4 id=\"bettertesting\">Better testing</h4>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The CMS code that was pushed live was tested indeed but it was tested only locally and pushed to production as the requirements were urgent. But, everything is urgent in a startup. Its easy to dig your own grave if you don't follow the practices that are important. <strong>We cannot get careless</strong>.  </li>\n<li>How was it not caught locally? The team testing the feature only tested the APIs that were used for getting promotions. They did not even imagine that the APIs that make use <code>products</code> mapping can get affected. On top of this, the issue surfaced up only when our content team started using the feature. We were actually sitting on a time bomb. Thank god it happened at night. Automated regression testing would have caught this issue. This is something we don't have and are prioritizing with every release.  </li>\n<li>Putting a <strong>review process</strong> around everything that goes into Elasticsearch, just like how you do the same thing around your RDBMS (you do that right?).  </li>\n<li><strong>Separating concerns</strong> is important. For some circumstances at the beginning of how systems were built, we relied on the CMS to index documents in Elasticsearch for the consumer app to consume those documents. Perhaps, if we had depended on consumer app to index their documents themselves, this issue could have gotten caught in the testing process by the consumer app team. May be it is time for us to move out the responsibility of indexing documents for search from CMS.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h4 id=\"readthefingdocs\">Read The F***ing Docs</h4>\n\n<p>Very aptly put in our world - I can't give more emphasis on this phrase. Nothing is magic. Nothing just works. As engineers, its our responsibility to get to the root of things and understand how this works. Had we made an effort to understand mappings better, which is such an essential part of running Elasticsearch, we would have not committed this mistake.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Elasticsearch is NOT bad at all. We love Elasticsearch. It would be difficult to imagine a lot of things we do today without Elasticsearch. But the low bar to entry can get you careless and have you shoot yourself in the foot.  </li>\n<li>This incident proved how careless we were with testing changes in pre-production environments. One of the reasons why this happened to us was not having sanitized pre-production environments for testing. We are working on bringing more dev-prod parity in our software release cycles.  </li>\n<li>This incident also taught us the importance of understanding the systems we use.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2 id=\"references\">References</h2>\n\n<p>A few links for further reading:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/found-elasticsearch-from-the-bottom-up\">Elasticsearch From The Bottom Up</a>  </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/mapping-intro.html#core-fields\">Elasticsearch: The Definitive Guide - Mappings</a>  </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/mapping.html\">Elasticsearch: The Definitive Guide - Types and Mappings</a> - has details on how Elasticsearch and Lucene work together under the hood  </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/merge-process.html\">Elasticsearch: The Definitive Guide - Segment Merging</a>  </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/1.4/indices-segments.html\">Elasticsearch - Indices Segments API</a>  </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-optimize.html\">Elasticsearch - Optimize API</a>  </li>\n<li>Lucene: <br>\n<ol><li><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/2705123/1060344\">What is a Lucene Segment?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://blog.mikemccandless.com/2011/02/visualizing-lucenes-segment-merges.html\">Visualizing Lucene's Segment Merges</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://lucene.apache.org/core/4_0_0/core/org/apache/lucene/codecs/lucene40/package-summary.html#file-names\">Lucene File Formats</a></li></ol></li>\n<li>Mailing list threads: <br>\n<ol><li><a href=\"http://elasticsearch-users.115913.n3.nabble.com/of-shards-vs-open-files-td3236433.html#a3238373\">Number of Shards vs. Open Files</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://elasticsearch-users.115913.n3.nabble.com/Optimize-in-Elastic-search-td2906964.html#a2911225\">Segment Merging</a></li></ol></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2 id=\"discussiononhackernews\">Discussion on Hacker News</h2>\n\n<p>Follow the discussion on <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10729776\">Hacker News</a>.</p>",

I think it should be generally applicable to other similar systems.</p>\n\n<p><em>Disclaimer: These are not facts. Because of inherent complexity and unpredictability of distributed systems, we cannot make specific theoretical predictions about their performance characteristics. If you want to apply these findings to your work, make measurements first.</em></p>\n\n<p>Let me define a couple of terms first</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>By <strong>API</strong> I mean inter-modular boundaries.   </li>\n<li>By <strong>backend services</strong> I mean the software that app server talks to. For example, Postgres, Redis or Elastic search. It excludes app servers themselves.   </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1 id=\"applicationstructure\">Application structure</h1>\n\n<p>An application structure that I found helpful in this work is</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"datalayer\">Data layer</h2>\n\n<p>This layer gets data and functionality from backend services and exposes <br>\nan API to other layers. The individual API calls perform these things</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Making service calls to backend services and get data.</li>\n<li>Construct some data representation for other layers.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It should be invisible to users of the API what is behind it. For example, \"user.get\" should not give any clues whether the data came from disk or memory. The advantages are</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>We can change implementation and data access patterns without altering the API.</li>\n<li>We can treat it as a single source of particular data. For example, cart object will contain all the behaviors of carts in our system.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"presentationlayer\">Presentation layer</h2>\n\n<p>This layer uses data API to create a response to be sent back to client. Presentation layer never makes direct requests to backend services.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"recipes\">Recipes</h1>\n\n<p>Now, let's get started with recipes. In this article, we will focus on data layer. We will talk about optimizing presentation layer in a future article. For illustration, I will consider this problem</p>\n\n<pre><code>We have Cart, User and Address models. The users and addresses are related via UserAddressMapping. We will assume that our hypothetical user has seven addresses.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2 id=\"measurefirst\">Measure first</h2>\n\n<p>Measurements are absolutely critical if you want to make any progress. This simple point gets overlooked in crunch times or with urgent business requirements. Optimizing without measurements is like solving a problem you don't know anything about.</p>\n\n<p>A stab at steps we can take for measurements are</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Determine metrics you want to optimize. It can be latency, cache misses or open connections.</li>\n<li>Make measurements on the metrics decided in first step. Profile the hell out of it.</li>\n<li>Determine actions needed to achieve the desired metric. These often would be straightforward. For example, for minimizing TCP connections to database, minimize queries to database.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For instance, my metric is latency and I want to minimize it. The key <br>\nis to measure execution time of individual requests. It would be nice if this leads to decrease in number of connections to backend but the priority is execution time.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"minimizequeries\">Minimize queries</h2>\n\n<p>Minimizing number of queries to backend leads to</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Reduced number of connections and hence decrease in memory consumption of backend due to decrease in number of file descriptors for open socket connections.</li>\n<li>Reduced number of forked processes if the server uses pre-fork model, which in turn leads to decrease in CPU utilization. A good example is <a href=\"http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.2/static/connect-estab.html\" title=\"Postgres: how connections are established in postgres\">Postgres </a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>However, this step may lead to more complex individual queries. How do you make sure it is the right tradeoff? <strong>Measurement</strong>! For disk-based storage like databases, make sure the number of disk seeks are same or decreasing (It may help if you know whether your database uses magnetic storage or solid storage).</p>\n\n<p>If you are using Django, read about <a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/models/querysets/#django.db.models.query.QuerySet.select_related\" title=\"Django: select-related\">select-related</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/models/querysets/#prefetch-related\" title=\"Django: prefetch-related\">prefetch-related</a> calls in query set API. If you are using Postgres, read how data is <a href=\"http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/storage.html\" title=\"Postgres: Storage\">laid out on disk</a> and <a href=\"http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/overview.html\" title=\"Postgres: Internals\">how queries are executed</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For example, suppose we want to get all the addresses of the user associated with a cart. The naive way to do it would be the following.</p>\n\n<pre><code>cart = Cart.objects.get(id=cart_id)\nowner = cart.owner\nmappings = UserAddressMapping.objects.filter(user=owner)\naddresses = [mapping.address.get_dict_representation()\n             for mapping in mappings]\nreturn addresses\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Execution Time in database machine</strong>: 17ms <br>\n<strong>Number of queries</strong>: 10.</p>\n\n<p>There is one query to get cart, one query to get cart user, one join query between UserAddressMapping and Address and seven individual queries to get seven addresses. </p>\n\n<p>Let's try to do it in a smarter way.</p>\n\n<pre><code>cart = Cart.objects.get(id=cart_id)\nowner_id = cart.owner_id\nmappings = UserAddressMapping.objects.filter(user_id=owner_id)\nmappings = mappings.select_related('address')\naddresses = [mapping.address.get_dict_representation()\n             for mapping in mappings]\nreturn addresses\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Execution time in database machine</strong>: 6 ms <br>\n<strong>Number of queries</strong>: 2 <br>\n<strong>Improvement in execution time</strong>: 10ms <br>\n<strong>Decrease in number of queries</strong>: 8   </p>\n\n<p>We avoided the query to get user (we just need user id to match it with \"owner_id\"). We also got all the addresses in one query using \"select_related\" on UserAddressMapping.</p>\n\n<p>This is huge considering the fact that in web development, every millisecond is critical (a rule of thumb is every request should be served in less than 200 ms). </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"divideouttasksbetweenbackendandapplication\">Divide out tasks between backend and application</h2>\n\n<p>You should determine what tasks should be done in application process and what in backend. Know the capabilities of your backend and your application platform (my hunch is all \"data-processing\" tasks should be done in backend services, but I am reluctant to make it a general recipe).</p>\n\n<p>For example, suppose we want to count all the active carts of a user. Let's suppose our hypothetical user have 37 carts. If we do it in application code, it would be something like this</p>\n\n<pre><code>len(GrCart.objects.filter(owner_id=user_id))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Execution time in application server</strong>: 4.8ms</p>\n\n<p>In this code, the application has to serialize all the incoming data to python objects. The better way would be</p>\n\n<pre><code>GrCart.objects.filter(owner_id=user_id).count()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Execution time in application server</strong>: 1.7ms <br>\n<strong>Improvement in execution time</strong>: 3ms   </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"executerequestsfordatainparallel\">Execute requests for data in parallel</h2>\n\n<p>The individual backend calls can be made from separate threads. The big caveat here is it must only involve calls to backend and should not involve any CPU work like serialization. The reason is python GIL prevents multiple threads to execute in separate processors. However, I/O requests can be made from separate threads since what you are essentially doing is waiting. See this <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29270818/why-is-a-python-i-o-bound-task-not-blocked-by-the-gil\" title=\"Stackoverflow: IO and GIL\">stackoverflow answer</a> for a discussion on this topic.</p>\n\n<p>So, if what you are doing is CPU intensive, it may be a net lose to employ threads, considering how hard it is to do in practice.</p>\n\n<p>There are some ways to sidestep GIL in python. We will talk about them in some future article if we happen to use them in production.</p>\n\n<p>For details regarding this issue, have a look at this excellent <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCs5OvhV9S4\">talk by David Beazley</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Let us try to count number of carts of two users</p>\n\n<pre><code>count1 = GrCart.objects.filter(owner_id=5813).count()\ncount2 = GrCart.objects.filter(owner_id=5814).count()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Execution time in application server</strong>: 3.4ms   </p>\n\n<p>If we use threads</p>\n\n<pre><code>pool = ThreadPool(processes=2)\ntarget1 = GrCart.objects.filter(owner_id=5813).count\ntarget2 = GrCart.objects.filter(owner_id=5814).count\ncount1_async = pool.apply_async(target1, args=())\ncount2_async = pool.apply_async(target2, args=())\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Execution time in application server excluding creation of thread pool</strong>: 2.5ms <br>\n<strong>Improvement in execution time</strong>: 1ms   </p>\n\n<h1 id=\"moreresources\">More resources</h1>\n\n<p>We cannot comprehensively discuss such a big topic in a small space. It involves lots of concepts from Operating Systems, Computer Networks and Compilers. But I hope it gives you a good starting point on what to do next.

(<code>d</code> is\nfor <em>down</em>)</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\" data-lang=\"bash\"><span class=\"c\"># fbr - checkout git branch</span>\nfbr<span class=\"o\">()</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"nb\">local </span>branches branch\n  <span class=\"nv\">branches</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"k\">$(</span>git branch<span class=\"k\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">&amp;&amp;</span>\n  <span class=\"nv\">branch</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"k\">$(</span><span class=\"nb\">echo</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"$branches\"</span> <span class=\"p\">|</span> fzf-tmux -d 15 +m<span class=\"k\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">&amp;&amp;</span>\n  git checkout <span class=\"k\">$(</span><span class=\"nb\">echo</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"$branch\"</span> <span class=\"p\">|</span> sed <span class=\"s2\">\"s/.* //\"</span><span class=\"k\">)</span>\n<span class=\"o\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>See:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://junegunn.kr/images/fbr.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>(When you're not on tmux, <code>fzf-tmux</code> will silently ignore <code>-[udlr]</code> options\nand simply fall back to the default behavior, so you can invariably use it in\nyour scripts.)</p>\n\n<p>I've always thought that the obligatory fullscreen mode of fzf was its major\ndrawback. But now with this fzf-tmux script, it's trivial to start fzf either\nin a split pane of any size on any position (up, down, left, right), and it\ndoes not leave incidental artifacts on your terminal unlike the other similar\ntools such as <a href=\"https://github.com/garybernhardt/selecta\">selecta</a>. So I'm starting to feel that fzf not trying\nto control the layout by itself and delegating the responsibility to a better\nsuited tool, in this case tmux, better follows <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy\">the Unix philosophy</a>.\n(\"Do one thing well!\")</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, the script is now on <a href=\"https://github.com/junegunn/fzf\">fzf repository</a>, and you can get it by a\ngit-pull. I also recommend rerunning the install script as fzf 0.9.4 has <a href=\"http://junegunn.kr/2015/03/fzf-0.9.4/\">a\nbackward incompatible change</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\" data-lang=\"bash\"><span class=\"nb\">cd</span> ~/.fzf <span class=\"o\">&amp;&amp;</span> git pull <span class=\"o\">&amp;&amp;</span> ./install\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Or if you're like me and manage fzf using <a href=\"https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug\">vim-plug</a> like follows:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"vim language-vim\" data-lang=\"vim\">Plug <span class=\"s1\">'junegunn/fzf'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> { <span class=\"s1\">'do'</span>: <span class=\"s1\">'yes \\| ./install'</span> }\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>a simple <code>:PlugUpdate fzf</code> will do.</p>\n\n<p>I'll probably release a new version on Homebrew as well. Please try it and\n<a href=\"https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/issues\">let me know</a> of any issues you run into. Thanks.</p>",

            "description": "<p>It hasn't been too long since <a href=\"https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen\">Pathogen</a> first came into being and widely\nadopted by the Vim community. Obviously the rapid growth of <a href=\"https://github.com/\">GitHub</a> has\nplayed a crucial role in the progress. Since then, we have observed the\nemergence of a wide variety of plugin managers, <a href=\"https://github.com/gmarik/vundle\">Vundle</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-manager\">vim-addon-manager</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim\">NeoBundle</a>, and so on. And even I came up with a\nsmall plugin manager called <a href=\"https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug\">vim-plug</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Before <a href=\"https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen\">Pathogen</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/\">GitHub</a>, we used to make our <code>~/.vim</code> directories\nall muddled up with the files downloaded from <a href=\"http://vim.org/scripts\">vim.org</a>,\npractically making it impossible to manage afterwards. But now we take it for\ngranted that we have version-controlled plugins in their own separate\ndirectories, and use fancy installers from plugin managers every day. So yeah,\ndefinitely we've come a long way, and I'm mostly happy with the status quo.</p>\n\n<p>However, there's one thing that has always irked me about Vim plugins, which is\nthe lack of proper dependency control mechanism. There's currently no way the\ndeveloper of a plugin can effectively enforce the users of the plugin to install\nthe prerequisites as well. The only option is to tell them to do so in the\ninstallation guide.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"... so in order to use my plugin you have to install A as well. And since A\nrequires B and C, you also have to install them.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But what if at one point plugin C is updated and suddenly requires yet another\nplugin? If you are the plugin developer, how can you keep track of such changes\nand how are you going to notify the users of your plugin? This rarely happens in\npractice, but I'm just suggesting that passing the burden of dependency\nmanagement on to the users has an inherent flaw. Also, a user with many plugins\ncan easily lose track of the dependencies among them and will not be able to\nremove a plugin without worrying about breaking the other ones.</p>\n\n<p>It's a headache. So instead of reusing preexisting plugins, a plugin developer\nis tempted to duplicate the code from them. Simply put, the lack of automatic\ndependency resolution discourages proper modularization of code. And I don't\nlike it.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"But they're just plugins for a text editor. Why do you care so much?\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I ask myself this and I know it's a fair question. Perhaps I'm being too serious\nabout Vim plugins. But my justification is that I'm a software engineer trained\nto frown upon any mindless copy-and-paste code so I couldn't just close my eyes\non this issue regarding my favorite everyday tool.</p>\n\n<p>I believe that <a href=\"https://github.com/gmarik/vundle\">Vundle</a> was heavily inspired by\n<a href=\"https://rubygems.org/\">Rubygems</a> (and <a href=\"http://bundler.io/\">Bundler</a>), however it misses the\nmost important point of it, dependency management. There are\n<a href=\"https://github.com/gmarik/vundle/issues/7\">requests</a> for it, but I\ndon't see it coming anytime soon. And its successor <a href=\"https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim\">NeoBundle</a> which offers\nmuch broader range of features, also has yet to address the issue. The author of\n<a href=\"https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim\">NeoBundle</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim/issues/117#issuecomment-19885002\">argues\nthat</a>\n<a href=\"http://vim.org/scripts\">vim.org</a> should be responsible for keeping track of the\ndependencies between the plugins and build a centralized database, which I agree\nto a certain extent, but I don't think it's happening in the near future.</p>\n\n<p>There is <a href=\"https://github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-manager-known-repositories\">a\ncommunity-attempt</a>\nto build such a database with dependency information, which is for\n<a href=\"https://github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-manager\">vim-addon-manager</a>. But I'm a bit skeptical about the scalability of this\ncentralized approach of building a single registry. Can we keep it up to date at\nall times? Can we make every plugin developer voluntarily update the registry?</p>\n\n<p>Instead, I believe each plugin should store its dependency information on its\nown repository, effectively building a distributed dependency database. The\nproblem is, there is no consensus on how it should be done. Obviously we don't\nhave \"Vim Plugin Standards Committee\" or something like that.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I mentioned in an earlier post that I had accidentally created a plugin\nmanager called <a href=\"https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug\">vim-plug</a>, whose most prominent feature is its lack of\nfeatures. It's so primitive that I have the luxury of prototyping an\nexperimental feature on it without too much headache.</p>\n\n<p>I had this simple idea of resolving the dependency of a Vim plugin. Each plugin\nhas a file called Plugfile in its root directory, which is simply a set of\n<code>Plug</code> commands. For example, if the content of Plugfile is as follows,</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"vim language-vim\" data-lang=\"vim\">Plug <span class=\"s1\">'junegunn/vim-emoji'</span>\nPlug <span class=\"s1\">'junegunn/vim-easy-align'</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>it means that this plugin requires those two other plugins to be installed. So\nif you install a plugin with a Plugfile using <a href=\"https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug\">vim-plug</a> (<em>wow, that's a lot\nof plugs in a sentence</em>),</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug\">vim-plug</a> first installs the plugin</li>\n<li>And sees if it has Plugfile</li>\n<li>The Plugfile is loaded and vim-plug discovers its dependent plugins</li>\n<li>Dependent plugins are installed as well, then their Plugfiles are\nexamined and their dependencies are resolved recursively.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This primitive dependency resolution scheme is now implemented on\n<a href=\"https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug\">vim-plug</a>, and you can read more about it\n<a href=\"https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug#dependency-resolution\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>See below how <a href=\"https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug\">vim-plug</a> installer handles plugins with Plugfiles:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.github.com/junegunn/i/master/vim-plug/Plugfile.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Despite the simplicity, it works just fine. (Yes, for now I'm completely\nignoring subtle issues like possible branch conflicts, etc.)</p>\n\n<p>However, this scheme has some fundamental problems.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>There is no plugin out there yet with the suggested Plugfile. This is no\nwonder since currently a very few people are using <a href=\"https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug\">vim-plug</a>, and I came\nup with this method just a few days ago. I'll definitely consider including\nPlugfile in my future projects, but will the other plugin developers agree on\nthe concept of it and add it to their repositories? I don't know.</p></li>\n<li><p>Plugfile uses <code>Plug</code> command, so the users of the other plugin managers will\nnot be likely to benefit from the presence of it. I decided to use <code>Plug</code>\ncommand simply because it was easier for me to implement with it at the\nmoment, but using a neutral data format such as JSON or YAML seems to be a\nbetter idea.</p></li>\n<li><p>It is always possible that a certain repository is renamed or removed from\nGitHub. In that case, all the references to it must be updated accordingly.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So basically this is still just a proof-of-concept implementation of dependency\nresolution and I cannot know how it will turn out. If you are a Vim plugin\ndeveloper and maintain a plugin with dependency, please consider adding a\nPlugfile to your repository.</p>\n\n<p>I'd love to hear your opinions on the issue. Feel free to <a href=\"mailto:junegunn.c@gmail.com\">e-mail\nme</a>, or <a href=\"https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug/issues\">create an\nissue</a> to discuss the matter.</p>\n\n<p>Happy Vimming. And don't miss the final episode of Breaking Bad.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Update:</p>\n\n<p>After I published this post, I found an interesting project tackling Vim plugin\ndependency, called <a href=\"https://www.relishapp.com/kana/vim-flavor/docs\">vim-flavor</a>. <a href=\"https://www.relishapp.com/kana/vim-flavor/docs\">vim-flavor</a> is a Vim plugin manager\ndistributed as a Ruby gem, which implements <a href=\"http://bundler.io/\">Bundler</a>-like dependency\nresolution scheme with <a href=\"http://semver.org/\">semantic versioning</a>. It relies on the presence of\n<a href=\"https://www.relishapp.com/kana/vim-flavor/docs/flavorfile\">Flavorfile</a> to\ndiscover the dependency of a plugin. The concept is similar to Plugfile, but it\nalso allows you to specify the required versions of the dependent plugins, while\nwith Plugfile you can only specifiy the branch or tag for each repository.  It's\na great project and you should check it out. However, it holds the same problem\nas <a href=\"https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug\">vim-plug</a>, that it uses its own syntax for dependency specification\nrather than using a neutral data format. The situation here is a bit different\nfrom that of the Ruby community which unanimously agreed upon the use of Gemfile\nfrom <a href=\"http://bundler.io/\">Bundler</a> (and gemspec of course). Many of the Vim users are already\nusing a number of different plugin managers, and we can't really expect\n<a href=\"https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug\">vim-plug</a> or <a href=\"https://www.relishapp.com/kana/vim-flavor/docs\">vim-flavor</a> to be a game changer. And although its\nambitious implementation of semantic versioning looks promising, in practice\nmost of the users and developers of Vim plugins don't seem to care much about\nversioning.</p>",

            "description": "<p>As the title says, I've finally ended up writing my own Vim plugin manager\ncalled <a href=\"https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug\">vim-plug</a>, so here's what happened.</p>\n\n<h2>State of the art</h2>\n\n<p>Today, we already have a whole range of Vim plugin managers, from the\nminimalistic, the father of all, <a href=\"https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen\">Pathogen</a> from the great\n<a href=\"http://tpo.pe/\">tpope</a>, to <a href=\"https://github.com/gmarik/vundle\">Vundle</a> with which you get a nice usability\nimprovement, and to seemingly the most fully-featured <a href=\"https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim\">NeoBundle</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There are also a number of minorities such as\n<a href=\"https://github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-manager\">vim-addon-manager</a> and\n<a href=\"https://github.com/gawel/oh-my-vim\">oh-my-vim</a>, both of which manage the lists\nof available Vim plugins.</p>\n\n<p>My choice was <a href=\"https://github.com/gmarik/vundle\">Vundle</a>. I really admire the simplicity of <a href=\"https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen\">Pathogen</a>,\nbut I don't want to manage git submodules, and having the explicit list of\nplugins in my .vimrc gives me a better sense of control. Later I found that\n<a href=\"https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim\">NeoBundle</a> could be a nice alternative, but realized that I didn't need any\nof its extra features at that point, so I decided to stick with <a href=\"https://github.com/gmarik/vundle\">Vundle</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Growing impatience</h2>\n\n<p>The number of plugins I use has been increased over time. Now I have more than\n30 plugins specified in my\n<a href=\"https://github.com/junegunn/dotfiles/blob/8646aae3aec418662d667b36444e771041ad0d23/vimrc#L12-L91\">.vimrc</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Now with 30 of them, it takes a considerable amount of time to update the\nplugins, or install them on a new machine. Maybe I'm exaggerating the problem a\nbit since it still takes less than 5 minutes. I could just fire up a new tmux\nsession and do something else while they're being done.</p>\n\n<p>It was obvious that the time could be greatly reduced if I could update plugins\nin parallel using multiple threads or processes. The simplest method would be\nto write a shell script that spawns multiple background processes each of which\nupdates a plugin.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\" data-lang=\"bash\"><span class=\"c\">#!/bin/bash</span>\n\n<span class=\"nv\">cnt</span><span class=\"o\">=</span>0\n<span class=\"nb\">cd</span> ~/.vim/bundle <span class=\"o\">&amp;&amp;</span>\n<span class=\"k\">for </span>d in *<span class=\"p\">;</span> <span class=\"k\">do</span>\n<span class=\"k\">  if</span> <span class=\"o\">[</span> -d <span class=\"nv\">$d</span>/.git <span class=\"o\">]</span><span class=\"p\">;</span> <span class=\"k\">then</span>\n<span class=\"k\">    </span><span class=\"nb\">echo</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"Updating $d\"</span>\n    <span class=\"nb\">cd</span> <span class=\"nv\">$d</span> <span class=\"o\">&amp;&amp;</span> git pull <span class=\"p\">&amp;</span>\n    <span class=\"c\"># Prevent having too many subprocesses</span>\n    <span class=\"o\">((</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span>cnt +<span class=\"o\">=</span> 1<span class=\"o\">)</span> % <span class=\"nv\">16</span> <span class=\"o\">==</span> 0 <span class=\"o\">))</span> <span class=\"o\">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class=\"nb\">wait</span>\n<span class=\"nb\">  </span><span class=\"k\">fi</span>\n<span class=\"k\">done</span>\n<span class=\"nb\">wait</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This simple script works pretty well if you have already installed the\nplugins. Maybe this is how it should be done considering that Vim in itself\ndoes not have any notion of parallel execution. But this irrational Vim addict\njust couldn't stop wanting to do the whole thing inside Vim without any external\nscripts.</p>\n\n<p>Although Vim itself does not have threads or background processes, there are a\ncouple of workarounds.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim\">NeoBundle</a> supports parallel installation using multiple processes.\nHowever that requires compilation of another plugin called vimproc from the\nsame author. As <del>my instinct told me to stay away from any compiled\nextension and</del> I wanted to simplify the initial setup process as much as\npossible, I looked for another option.</p></li>\n<li><p>With Ruby/Python interface we can create threads. I personally prefer Ruby\nand the current version of Mac OS X is shipped with a Ruby-enabled Vim, so I\ndecided to write a parallel update procedure in Ruby.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>And yes, it worked. You can see my first, now deprecated, prototype\nimplementation <a href=\"https://github.com/junegunn/vimfiles/commit/5806196\">here</a>,\nwhich uses <code>g:bundles</code> variable from <a href=\"https://github.com/gmarik/vundle\">Vundle</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>The next step</h2>\n\n<p>The obvious next step was to merge this parallel update procedure into\n<a href=\"https://github.com/gmarik/vundle\">Vundle</a>, so if a user is running a Ruby-enabled Vim, <a href=\"https://github.com/gmarik/vundle\">Vundle</a> will\nautomatically install/update plugins in parallel. So many people would benefit\nfrom this update! But sadly that didn't happen. I couldn't find a place for my\ncode in the <a href=\"https://github.com/gmarik/vundle\">Vundle</a> codebase without introducing a major overhaul. Much of\nits logic relies too much on the content of the status window. And it was\ninstantly obvious that it would require too much effort to make it flexible\nenough to embrace my code.</p>\n\n<p>I could just stop there. Using <a href=\"https://github.com/gmarik/vundle\">Vundle</a> as it is with my own parallel update\nfunction. But I then realized that I had accidentally reimplemented the core\npart of <a href=\"https://github.com/gmarik/vundle\">Vundle</a> by writing that piece of code. Well then, why not just\nbuild my own custom-tailored plugin manager that is easier for me to use and\ngives me just what I need? So that's how <a href=\"https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug\">vim-plug</a> started.</p>\n\n<h2>Goals and achivements</h2>\n\n<p>I wanted my own plugin manager to be as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Should be easier to setup, require less boilerplate code</li>\n<li>Minimal features</li>\n<li>Of course, parallel installation and update\n\n<ul>\n<li>But fall back to plain Vimscript when Ruby is not available</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Be able to switch plugins of the same name from different authors</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To summarize, it's positioned somewhere between <a href=\"https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen\">Pathogen</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/gmarik/vundle\">Vundle</a>,\nbut with the new parallel update feature.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug\">vim-plug</a> is indeed easier to setup. To install <a href=\"https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug\">vim-plug</a> you just\nneed to download\n<a href=\"https://raw.github.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim\">a single file from GitHub</a>\nand put it in <code>~/.vim/autoload</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\" data-lang=\"bash\">mkdir -p ~/.vim/autoload\ncurl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim <span class=\"se\">\\</span>\n  https://raw.github.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>And it doesn't require any unfathomable boilerplate code in your .vimrc, you\njust write down the list of plugins with <code>Plug</code> command between <code>plug#begin()</code>\nand <code>plug#end()</code>. That's all you have to do. (And you see, <code>Plug</code> is 2-byte\nshorter than <code>Bundle</code>, so you save a huge amount of disk space!)</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"vim language-vim\" data-lang=\"vim\"><span class=\"k\">call</span> plug#begin<span class=\"p\">()</span>\n\nPlug <span class=\"s1\">'junegunn/seoul256'</span>\nPlug <span class=\"s1\">'junegunn/vim-easy-align'</span>\n<span class=\"c\">\" Plug 'user/repo', 'branch_or_tag'</span>\n<span class=\"c\">\" Plug 'git@github.com:junegunn/vim-github-dashboard.git'</span>\n<span class=\"c\">\" ...</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">call</span> plug#<span class=\"k\">end</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Now you are loaded with the essential PlugInstall, PlugUpdate, PlugClean, and\nPlugUpgrade commands.</p>\n\n<p>PlugInstall and PlugUpdate will install and update plugins in parallel if you're\nrunning a Ruby-enabled Vim. It gives me an order of magnitude speedup.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.github.com/junegunn/i/master/vim-plug/pi.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.github.com/junegunn/i/master/vim-plug/pu.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Notice that the status window doesn't look as nice as that of <a href=\"https://github.com/gmarik/vundle\">Vundle</a>, but\nwell, that's good enough for me, for now.</p>\n\n<h2>Status of vim-plug</h2>\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug\">vim-plug</a> works for me</em>. And that's the whole point. I will not add any\nextra feature that I don't think I need just because somebody wants it. I don't\nexpect people to abandon their current plugin managers and adopt <a href=\"https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug\">vim-plug</a>,\nand it is highly likely that I will be the only one using it in the end, but I\ndon't care. It was fun building it, and I learned a lot more about Vim in the\nprocess.</p>\n\n<p>If you're still curious <a href=\"https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug\">try it, fork it</a>,\nor even try writing a yet another plugin manager for yourself.\nWhy? Because you can, and it's a lot of fun.</p>",

            "description": "<p><a href=\"http://mp.binaervarianz.de/oopsla2015.pdf\">Performance Problems You Can Fix: A Dynamic Analysis of Memoization Opportunities</a><br>\nLuca Della Toffola, Michael Pradel, Thomas Gross<br>\n2015<br>\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\nPerformance bugs are a prevalent problem and recent research proposes various techniques to identify such bugs. This paper addresses a kind of performance problem that often is easy to address but difficult to identify: redundant computations that may be avoided by reusing already computed results for particular inputs, a technique called memoization. To help developers find and use memoization opportunities, we present MemoizeIt, a dynamic analysis that identifies methods that repeatedly perform the same computation. The key idea is to compare inputs and outputs of method calls in a scalable yet precise way. To avoid the overhead of comparing objects at all method invocations in detail, MemoizeIt first compares objects without following any references and iteratively increases the depth of exploration while shrinking the set of considered methods. After each iteration, the approach ignores methods that cannot benefit from memoization, allowing it to analyze calls to the remaining methods in more detail.

This paper addresses a kind of performance problem that often is easy to address but difficult to identify: redundant computations that may be avoided by reusing already computed results for particular inputs, a technique called memoization. To help developers find and use memoization opportunities, we present MemoizeIt, a dynamic analysis that identifies methods that repeatedly perform the same computation. The key idea is to compare inputs and outputs of method calls in a scalable yet precise way. To avoid the overhead of comparing objects at all method invocations in detail, MemoizeIt first compares objects without following any references and iteratively increases the depth of exploration while shrinking the set of considered methods. After each iteration, the approach ignores methods that cannot benefit from memoization, allowing it to analyze calls to the remaining methods in more detail. For every memoization opportunity that MemoizeIt detects, it provides hints on how to implement memoization, making it easy for the developer to fix the performance issue. Applying MemoizeIt to eleven real-world Java programs reveals nine profitable memoization opportunities, most of which are missed by traditional CPU time profilers, conservative compiler optimizations, and other existing approaches for finding performance bugs.

            "description": "<p>In this post, I’ll be explaining the exciting changes coming to JavaScript with ES6 arrow functions. After reading this post, you will have a solid understanding of ES6 arrow functions. You will be able to write functions using the new syntax. You will be able to explain its new features to your friends and colleagues. The best part is it should only take you a few minutes.</p><p>There’s plenty to happy about!</p><h2>Arrow Function Expression</h2><p>The first thing you will notice about ES6 arrow functions is the new syntax. The ES6 arrow function expression syntax is shorter than the current function expression. That is great news to any JavaScript engineer. You get to cut down on characters and file size&nbsp;without taking away from code readability.</p><p><em>Note: You may see some people refer to them as fat arrow functions.</em></p><h3>Syntax</h3><div class=\"gist-oembed\" data-gist=\"jaspervalero/d0acc37553b3d3c8fd8e.json\"></div><h3>1, 2, 3 Arrow Function</h3><p><a href=\"http://jaspervalero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/1-2-3.jpg?189db0\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-250\" src=\"http://jaspervalero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/1-2-3.jpg?189db0\" alt=\"ES6 Arrow Functions as easy as 1, 2, 3\" width=\"760\" height=\"441\" srcset=\"http://jaspervalero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/1-2-3-300x174.jpg 300w, http://jaspervalero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/1-2-3.jpg 760w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px\"></a></p><p>You may find it helpful to break the process required to create an arrow function up into three steps:</p><h4>1. Provide the parameters</h4><div class=\"gist-oembed\" data-gist=\"jaspervalero/1336c685270bcb6c8d25.json\"></div><h4>2. Add in that fat arrow goodness</h4><div class=\"gist-oembed\" data-gist=\"jaspervalero/c8b4e2977eb792b257bb.json\"></div><h4>3. Define the body of the function</h4><div class=\"gist-oembed\" data-gist=\"jaspervalero/bf14fdd48bf9eb07880d.json\"></div><h2>Lambdas!</h2><p>One of the key things to note is that when you only use one argument the function returns the result implicitly. You don’t have to use the return keyword. This is quite handy for lots of scenarios. Other programming languages refer to this style as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_expression\" target=\"_blank\">lambdas</a>.</p><div class=\"gist-oembed\" data-gist=\"jaspervalero/35c25edd74e65237f4f3.json\"></div><p>In the above code, the result of number * number is automatically returned. So you will see 25 in your console. I have some ideas of how you can put this to use in JavaScript. I may write a more detailed post on lambdas at some point in the future. Make sure and let me know in the comments if you’d find that useful.</p><h2>Lexical this Binding</h2><p>In earlier versions of JavaScript, the context of <em><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">this</span></em> was dynamic.&nbsp;Every new function defined its own <em><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">this</span></em> value. In ES6, <em><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">this</span></em> is lexically bound. Simply put, it retains a reference to the enclosing context. I’ll give you some examples so you can understand the full benefit of a lexical <em><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">this</span></em>. Say you wanted to create a Gamer class to track play time for a game you’re making.</p><p>In ES5, you might try writing the following code:</p><div class=\"gist-oembed\" data-gist=\"jaspervalero/0161b975e531666566fb.json\"></div><p>A typical solution for handling the problem in&nbsp;the current version of JavaScript would be to do something like:</p><div class=\"gist-oembed\" data-gist=\"jaspervalero/53f38d9b413caa5846ca.json\"></div><p>With ES6 arrow functions, <span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"><em>this</em></span> refers to the enclosing context. So you can use:</p><div class=\"gist-oembed\" data-gist=\"jaspervalero/20dda9ee6fc36489d80f.json\"></div><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Well, that is a quick overview of ES6 arrow functions. I hope you feel like you’ve leveled up your ES6 knowledge. You should be ready to begin taking on ES6 arrow functions.</p><p>You should spend some time practicing what you’ve learned. If you haven’t already, make sure to check out my post, <a href=\"http://jaspervalero.com/you-need-to-know-that-es6-has-arrived/\">You Need To Know That ES6 Has Arrived</a>. It will get you motivated to start putting your ES6 knowledge to use now.</p><p>If you’ve found this post helpful, please make sure and leave a comment. Let me know how I’m doing. It helps me a lot.</p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://jaspervalero.com/why-javascript-es6-arrow-functions-will-make-you-happy/\">Why JavaScript ES6 Arrow Functions Will Make You Happy</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://jaspervalero.com\">JasperValero.com</a>.</p>",

I think it is more than that.</p><p>My belief is that we are at the tipping point. We will continue to see ES6 mentioned until it is the mainstream flavor. Then we’ll just start referring to it as JavaScript again.</p><h2>The Mouths Of Giants</h2><p>I’m sure you’ve heard the <a href=\"http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton\">Sir Isaac Newton</a> quote about “standing on the shoulders of giants”. What about the mouths of giants?&nbsp;It is important to take notice of what the titans in the JavaScript community have been saying about ES6.</p><p>Many well-known names in the community have shared their support of using ES6 already.&nbsp;I’m not talking about the type of people who take blind leaps of faith. I’m talking about JavaScript thought leaders. Thankfully, they’ve been vocal about their reasons.</p><h3>Guillermo Rauch</h3><p><em>of LearnBoost, Socket.io, Automattic</em></p><p>Guillermo recently said:</p><blockquote><p>“For the past few months I’ve been exclusively writing ECMAScript 6 code by taking advantage of transpilation to a currently supported version of JavaScript.”</p></blockquote><p>He went on to say:</p><blockquote><p>“Adopting ES6 has simultaneously resulted in increased productivity (by making my code more succinct) and eliminated entire classes of bugs by addressing common JavaScript gotchas.”</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"http://rauchg.com/2015/ecmascript-6/\">Source</a></p><h3>Brendan Eich</h3><p><em>the creator of JavaScript, member of the ECMAScript Committee</em></p><p>Brendan had this to say about ES6:</p><blockquote><p>“Most new features can be used now…”</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/113913703\">Source</a></p><h3>Dave Herman</h3><p><em>Founder and Principal Researcher at Mozilla Research, member of the ECMAScript Committee</em></p><p>In an interview with Dave about ES6 he said:</p><blockquote><p>“We can gather real world feedback from communities of early adopters, and the transpiler implementors become subject matter experts who can provide invaluable feedback combining the implementor’s perspective with the user developer’s perspective.”</p></blockquote><p>He also touched on the positive impact it has on browsers:</p><blockquote><p>“Allowing developers to start using features sooner helps provide greater pressure on browser vendors to implement features natively.”</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"http://es6rocks.com/2014/07/es6-interview-with-david-herman/\">Source</a></p><p>That is just a few who have made the switch to ES6. There are plenty more developers who are joining them. There are entire open source project teams who are making the change.</p><h2>ES6 Called Dibs On Your Libs</h2><p>A natural by-product of&nbsp;JavaScript engineers moving to ES6 is the migration of libraries and frameworks. The community is now starting to see projects rewritten in ES6 and support being added to them. Don’t be surprised when some of you favorite libs and tools follow suit. Maybe they already have.</p><p>Here are a few examples:</p><h3>io.js</h3><p>Take <a href=\"https://iojs.org\">io.js</a>, for example. Here we have a fork of <a href=\"http://nodejs.org/\">Node.js</a> done by the core contributors of Node.js. One of the first things they did was update the <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/v8/\">V8</a>&nbsp;JavaScript engine to support as&nbsp;much of ES6 as possible. You can read more about how they’ve exposed these features on the <a href=\"https://iojs.org/en/es6.html\">io.js&nbsp;ES6 page</a>.</p><h3>Meteor.js</h3><p><a href=\"http://www.meteor.com\">Meteor.js</a> adds support for ES6 with the <a href=\"https://atmospherejs.com/mquandalle/harmony\">harmony</a> package. It allows you to write your&nbsp;apps in ES6. The files are then transpiled to ES5 using tools that are all within the <a href=\"https://atmospherejs.com/\">Atmosphere</a> ecosystem.</p><h3>Backbone + ES6</h3><p>In his <a href=\"https://github.com/addyosmani/todomvc-backbone-es6\">Backbone TodoMVC + ECMAScript6 repo on Github</a>, Addy Osmani shows us how we can build Backbone apps using ES6.</p><p>Search around for ES6 tutorials and support for your favorite JavaScript libs. Chances are you’ll find someone talking about it. If not, then considering starting the conversation yourself.</p><h2>Why You Should Start Using ES6 Now</h2><p>It would be foolish to ignore the growing momentum behind ES6. Now is the perfect time to start using ES6. You need this. Your team needs this. The community needs it.</p><p>Think about the vast number of JavaScript projects that exist. Now realize they all need tools and support built around them for ES6. In a way, there is a blank canvas to take advantage of. Plenty to do. Open source projects will be begging for help.</p><p>And remember the wisdom that Dave Herman shared. We can help push native browser support forward by adopting early. Let that motivate you to do your part.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Should you begin writing exclusively in ES6, transpiling to ES5 and shipping? I don’t know. You will have to decide if that makes sense for your projects and production environments.</p><p>You should begin using it in some capacity. This will help you avoid the last-minute rush to try and get caught up. I believe mainstream adoption is coming sooner than some might think.</p><p>I’d also like to say that I’m in the same boat. I’ve just started using ES6 myself. I’m still learning and would love to hear about your own experiences with ES6. Please share your own thoughts and ideas below in the comments.</p><p>Now that I’ve convinced you that coding in ES6 is the smart thing to do, I won’t leave you hanging. Over the next few weeks, I’ll be writing a lot about ES6. I’ll point out all its new features. I’ll show you how to get up and running in the browser with transpilation. I’ll be sharing my own experiences. I’ll also be doing a round up of the best ES6 resources.

            "description": "<p>The longer I'm programming and creating software, the more I notice that I\nbuild a lot of stuff that requires maintenance even though it should not.\nIn particular a topic that just keeps annoying me is how quickly\ntechnology moves forward and how much effort it is to maintain older code\nthat still exists but now stands on ancient foundations.</p>\n<p>This is not a new discovery mind you.  This blog you're reading started\nout as a Django application many, many years ago; made a transition to\nWordPress because I could not be bothered with updating Django; and then\nturned into two different static site generators because I did not want to\nbother with making database updates and rather wanted to track my content\nin a git repository.</p>\n<p>I like static website generators quite a bit.  As everything needs a\nwebsite these days — it's impossible to escape the work to create one.\nFor programmers it's possible to get away with building something with\nstatic website generators like Jekyll, Hexo, Hugo, Pelican, Hyde, Brunch,\nMiddleman, Harp, Expose, …</p>\n<p>As you can see the list of tools available is endless.  Unfortunately\nthough these tools are all aimed at programmers and it's very hard to use\nthem as someone without programming experience.  Worse though: many of\nthem are clones of each other just written in different programming\nlanguages with very similar designs.  There is very little innovation in\nthat space and that's a bit unfortunate because I like the flexibility I\nget from frameworks like Flask at times.</p>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"so-i-built-my-own\">\n<h2>So I Built My Own</h2>\n<p>This is by far not the first time I built a static website generator but I\nhope it will be the last time.  This one however is different from any\nproject I built before.  The reason it exists is quite frankly that it's\nimpossible to escape family duties.  For me that means helping out with\nthe website of my parents.  I knew that I did not want that to be\nWordPress or something that needs security updates so about two years ago\nI started to investigate that options there are.</p>\n<p>After a ton of toying around I ended up using <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"http://pythonhosted.org/Frozen-Flask/\">Frozen-Flask</a> for that project.  It was neat\nbecause it allowed me to structure the website exactly like I wanted.\nHowever it also meant that whenever text started to change I needed to\nspend time on it.  Thus I had to investigate CMS solutions again.\nCountless weekends were wasted trying to make WordPress work again and\nlooking at Statamic.  However I found them quite a bit more complex to\ncustomize than what I was used to with Frozen-Flask and they did not\nreally fit the format at all.  Especially WordPress feels much more like a\nblog engine than a CMS.</p>\n<p>Finally I decided to sit down and build something completely different: a\ncontent management system that uses flat files as source files like most\nother systems, but it has a locally hosted admin panel that a non\nprogrammer can use.  You install the application, double click on the\nproject, a browser opens and you can edit the pages.  It builds in the\nbackground into static HTML files and there is a publish button to ship it\nup to a server.  For collaboration one can use Dropbox.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"enter-lektor\">\n<h2>Enter Lektor</h2>\n<p>I called this system Lektor and Open Sourced it initially a few months ago\nafter not having cared about it in a year or so.  However I had another\nrun-in with a project which was the Sentry documentation.  Sentry uses\nSphinx for the documentation and customizing the docs for what we had in\nmind there turned out to be a complete waste of time and sanity.  While\nLektor is currently not in a position where it could replace Sphinx for\nSentry it gave me enough motivation to hack on it again on weekends.</p>\n<p>So I figured I might retry Open Sourcing it and made a website for it with\ndocumentation and cleaned up some bad stuff in it.</p>\n<p>Here is what it looks like when you open up the admin panel:</p>\n<img alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lektor/lektor-archive/master/screenshots/admin.png\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lektor/lektor-archive/master/screenshots/admin.png\" style=\"width: 100%;\">\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"lektor-is-a-framework\">\n<h2>Lektor is a Framework</h2>\n<p>But what makes Lektor so much fun to work with is that Lektor is (while\nvery opinionated) very, very flexible.  It takes a lot of inspiration from\nORMs like Django's.  Instead of there being a \"blog component\" you can model\nyour own blog posts and render them with the templates you want to use.\nThere is not a single built-in template that you have to use.  The only\nthing it gives you is a quickstart that sets up the folders and copies\ndefault minimalistic templates over.</p>\n<p>As an example, here is how a blog index template looks like:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span class=\"cp\">{%</span> <span class=\"k\">extends</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"blog_layout.html\"</span> <span class=\"cp\">%}</span>\n<span class=\"cp\">{%</span> <span class=\"k\">from</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"macros/pagination.html\"</span> <span class=\"k\">import</span> <span class=\"nv\">render_pagination</span> <span class=\"cp\">%}</span>\n<span class=\"cp\">{%</span> <span class=\"k\">block</span> <span class=\"nv\">title</span> <span class=\"cp\">%}</span>My Blog<span class=\"cp\">{%</span> <span class=\"k\">endblock</span> <span class=\"cp\">%}</span>\n<span class=\"cp\">{%</span> <span class=\"k\">block</span> <span class=\"nv\">body</span> <span class=\"cp\">%}</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&lt;h1&gt;</span>My Blog<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>\n\n  <span class=\"nt\">&lt;ul</span> <span class=\"na\">class=</span><span class=\"s\">\"blog-index\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"cp\">{%</span> <span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"nv\">post</span> <span class=\"k\">in</span> <span class=\"nv\">this.pagination.items</span> <span class=\"cp\">%}</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">&lt;li&gt;</span>\n      <span class=\"nt\">&lt;a</span> <span class=\"na\">href=</span><span class=\"s\">\"</span><span class=\"cp\">{{</span> <span class=\"nv\">post</span><span class=\"o\">|</span><span class=\"nf\">url</span> <span class=\"cp\">}}</span><span class=\"s\">\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span><span class=\"cp\">{{</span> <span class=\"nv\">post.title</span> <span class=\"cp\">}}</span><span class=\"nt\">&lt;/a&gt;</span> —\n      by <span class=\"cp\">{{</span> <span class=\"nv\">post.author</span> <span class=\"cp\">}}</span>\n      on <span class=\"cp\">{{</span> <span class=\"nv\">post.pub_date</span><span class=\"o\">|</span><span class=\"nf\">dateformat</span> <span class=\"cp\">}}</span>\n  <span class=\"cp\">{%</span> <span class=\"k\">endfor</span> <span class=\"cp\">%}</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>\n\n  <span class=\"cp\">{%</span> <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"nv\">this.pagination.pages</span> <span class=\"o\">&gt;</span> <span class=\"m\">1</span> <span class=\"cp\">%}</span>\n    <span class=\"cp\">{{</span> <span class=\"nv\">render_pagination</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">this.pagination</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"cp\">}}</span>\n  <span class=\"cp\">{%</span> <span class=\"k\">endif</span> <span class=\"cp\">%}</span>\n<span class=\"cp\">{%</span> <span class=\"k\">endblock</span> <span class=\"cp\">%}</span>\n</pre></div>\n<p>The system understands what the blog is, that it has child record, that\nthose records are paginated, it can provide pagination etc.  However there\nis nothing in there that makes it a blog in itself.  It just has a very\nflexible ORM inspired component that gives access to the structured files\non the file system.  Programming for Lektor feels very much like\nprogramming something with Flask or Django.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"learn-more\">\n<h2>Learn More</h2>\n<p>If you want to learn more about it, there are quite a few resources at\nthis point:</p>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li><a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://www.getlektor.com/\">The Lektor Website</a>, with documentation\nand all that cool stuff.</li>\n<li><a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://www.getlektor.com/blog/2015/12/hello-lektor/\">Introduction Blog Post</a>,\nwith some more back story and explanations of how it works.</li>\n<li><a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://www.getlektor.com/docs/guides/\">A Few Guides</a> on how to\nbuild blogs, portfolio websites, etc.</li>\n<li><a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://www.getlektor.com/docs/quickstart/\">A Quickstart</a> with a\nscreencast to show the basics.</li>\n<li><a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://www.getlektor.com/docs/deployment/travisci/\">A Deployment Guide for Lektor + GitHub Pages</a> that shows how\nto put something up with the help of Travis-CI (which also includes a\nshort screencast).</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"final-words\">\n<h2>Final Words</h2>\n<p>I hope people find it useful.  I know that I enjoy using it a ton and I\nhope it makes others enjoy it similarly.  Because I run so many Open\nSource projects and maintenance of all of them turns out to be tricky I\nfigured I do this better this time around.  Lektor belongs to a separate\norg and the project does not use any resources only I have access to\n(other than the domain name and the server travis-CI deploys to).  So in\ncase people want to help out, there is no single point of failure!</p>\n<p>I hope I can spend some time over Christmas to do the same to my other\nprojects and alter the bus factor of them.</p>\n<p>There is far too much in Lektor to be able to cover it in a single blog\npost so I will probably write a bit more about some of the really cool\nthings about in in the next few weeks.  Enjoy!</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<p>Habits aren’t easy. They take time, effort and concentration to get right. When I decided to start improving my habits I wanted to start with one that meant a lot to me, one that I could focus on and develop a pattern for getting good at making (and keeping) habits.</p>\n<p>That’s why I started with water – the source of life. Drinking enough water is associated with both<a href=\"http://authoritynutrition.com/7-health-benefits-of-water/\"> physical and mental well being</a>, two things I know I want to work on in the future. It seemed to me there was really nothing else I could have chosen to begin with.</p>\n<h2>How Much Water is Enough Water?</h2>\n<p>As I started this challenge I remembered an article I read a while ago that explained why <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/25/upshot/no-you-do-not-have-to-drink-8-glasses-of-water-a-day.html?_r=0\">the common ‘eight glasses a day’ measure of water is wrong</a> . In his article, Aaron E Carroll explains that this is a myth as, although it may be close to the right amount, it doesn’t take into account water consumed through food. In fact, nor does it consider individual body size, diet or exercise regime.</p>\n<p>I did some more research and found many of the types of article that Carroll debunks – fluffy articles on getting eight glasses with no reference to science. Then I stumbled on a recent piece from one of my favourite writers, Oliver Burkeman of ‘This Column Will Change Your Life’. In it, he argues that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/sep/25/drink-eight-glasses-of-water-a-day-oliver-burkeman\">the ‘eight glasses’ guideline remains useful</a> as it forces us to cut out sugary drinks to get in eight glasses of pure water, gets us thinking about how much we drink and going to the bathroom more often keeps us active.</p>\n<p>I found a lot of wisdom in these words and in Carroll’s suggestion that our bodies are finely tuned to tell us when we need water – it’s a survival instinct after all. I decided that, for me, drinking about one litre or five glasses a day seemed manageable and healthy. I’d keep my mind open if this didn’t feel right later on.</p>\n<h2>How Do I Drink Enough Water Every Day?</h2>\n<p>The short answer is, I don’t. Sometimes I don’t quite get my five glasses, but most days I do. On a technical level, according to Aaron E Carroll, I always get enough because I haven’t yet suffered from fatal dehydration.</p>\n<p>That said, I now consider five glasses to be ‘enough’ for me. However, I didn’t start with five, I started with one. And I drank it when I got up, so my habit was done before I left for work. Nothing to worry about for the rest of the day.</p>\n<p>After two weeks, I added a second glass. Again, I thought about exactly when I’d drink this glass so it didn’t become a floating obligation. I’d drink my second glass at 11am in place of my usual tea break.</p>\n<p>Another two weeks and I added a third glass, this time at lunch. I was now drinking three glasses of water a day before the afternoon really began. I’d gone from hardly ever remember to drink water to over halfway to my target in just six weeks.</p>\n<p>As you’d expect, I added my fourth glass in week eight. That’s where things got tough. I found myself feeling full of water by the end of the day, struggling to drink anything in the evenings. My body wasn’t used to the water intake, even though I’d built up slowly. I decided to hold off adding the fifth glass until I was ready for it.</p>\n<p>That took longer than I expected, but I now feel able to add my final glass over the next month. Most days I’m already there, so I know I can do it.</p>\n<h2>What Did I Learn?</h2>\n<p>The main lesson to take from this experiment is that habit building takes time, but not as much time as you might think. Once I let go of the impatience that told me I should drink eight glasses of water every day, immediately, I found a way to make the habit work for me. With a bit of research, I was able to settle on a healthy and realistic target. And, even though I spaced out the increases in my routine, I was able to go from no regular water intake to one litre in just two months.</p>\n<p>The hardest part of my new habit is the weekend, where my schedule can be very changeable depending on what my family are doing that day, what the weather is like and if we have any visitors. Throughout the week, it’s easy to tie each glass to a regular event, but the weekends have saggy middles and I often find myself drinking late at night to catch up. Oliver Burkeman was certainly right about one thing – it’s a great way to get some exercise going to the bathroom in the dark.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you make sure you drink enough water?

            "description": "<p>Is there something more depression than having zero creativity? You know you want to create something but don’t know what. Or perhaps you have a problem, but can’t find the proper solution. Sometimes your brain is just not in full power. You see all those people on the internets creating amazing things. Why can’t you create stuff like that?</p>\n<p>I know the feeling!</p>\n<p>I’ve had some very creative times in my life, but I’ve also had some very depressing times where I felt like the dumbest person on earth. Throughout the years, I’ve studied famous creative people and tried various ways to stimulate my creativity.</p>\n<p>Here are the three techniques that worked best. Each one worked very well but at different times, often in combination.</p>\n<h3>1. Break a habit</h3>\n<p>The best way to have no creativity is to turn your brain off. When your whole day or week is a routine you don’t even have to think to complete, you’re basically living on autopilot. Changing small things in a routine can have a huge impact on your creativity.</p>\n<p>Take a different path to work. Change haircut. Change your lunch menu. Anything small or big will stimulate your brain. I’ve used this technique numerous times.</p>\n<p>Also, changing a habit will stimulate you to change other ones. So if you want to change something important, change some small things first, which will give you motivation (doing something new is always exciting isn’t it?). Then, use that motivation and confidence to change something bigger.</p>\n<p>The point is to get momentum. This also work for anything you want to accomplish, not only having more creativity.</p>\n<h3>2. Be alone</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Be alone, that is the secret of invention: be alone, that is when ideas are born. <em>- Nikola Tesla</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Solitude is greatly underrated. I believe no serious work, deep thinking or innovation is possible with people around you.</p>\n<p>This has nothing to do with being introvert or not. Creating requires a high level of concentration which can’t be reached when there are people around. You can’t still get with people before of after that process to get feedback or re-energize.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Without great solitude no serious work is possible. <em>- Pablo Picasso</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And by alone, I also mean no IM, Twitter, Facebook or such.</p>\n<h3>3. Get bored</h3>\n<p>Here’s an easy way to get bored: consume less. Not because I believe consuming is bad, but because I think it forces us to the other side: producing.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Necessity is the mother of invention. <em>- Unknown</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Get bored long enough and I assure you getting unbored by creating will become a necessity.</p>\n<p>I remember having no internet when I was younger on my parents computer. That’s why I first learn to program, there was nothing else to do on that damn thing!</p>\n<p>Drop a comment below and let me know if you have any tip of your own to stimulate your creativity!</p>",

            "description": "<p style=\"float:right;\"><a href=\"http://owningrails.com/\"><img src=\"http://owningrails.com/images/ad.png\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>I initially learned Rails with the book <a href=\"http://www.pragprog.com/titles/rails2/agile-web-development-with-rails\">Agile Web development with Rails</a>, but the thing that made Rails click for me was not building a sample app, it was seeing all the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern_(computer_science)\">design patterns</a> I studied long and hard before being applied and playing well together. It didn’t take me long to pick up Rails and master it. And I know this is because the architecture and design choices behind it made so much sense to me.</p>\n<p>Seeing all the Rails tutorials popping-up, I feel they are taking the wrong approach. I don’t think you can deeply understand Rails by playing with it’s APIs, building a simple app in a few hours. I think you need to understand how it works and everything will fall into place. Once you do, you are no longer feeling stuck in the framework.</p>\n<p>So a few weeks ago, I was inspired by <a href=\"http://javascriptmasterclass.com/\">Amy Hoy and Thomas Fuchs’ Javascript Master Class</a> in launching my own online class to teach Rails. I’ve always enjoyed teaching people about Rack, EventMachine, Thin, programming language creation and virtual machines at conferences and user groups. But I know the most useful thing I can teach is Rails. I truly believe that once you know enough about Rails you enjoy web development much more. But this is hard to understand until you actually do… know enough about Rails. And what is “enough”?</p>\n<p>Well, from my experience, “enough” is understanding three key things:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>the design patterns behind Rails</li>\n\t<li>the naming conventions</li>\n\t<li>the coding style</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And you don’t need a CS degree to understand any of these and you certainly don’t need to know by heart any of the APIs.</p>\n<p>That is why I’m using the same approach I’ve been using for years for teaching: with code. Not only with live coding sessions, but with code samples, straight from inside Rails, explaining how stuff work. I want to teach you how to read Rails code, and believe me, it’s way easier than some people think.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://owningrails.com/\">Register now for the May edition or my <strong>Owning Rails online Master Class</strong>!</a></p>\n<p>Yay!</p>",

That was awesome. I don’t think anything could validate a newly-founded Linux user group more than having industry leaders come joke with you about tiling window managers. Quoting Tom:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The venn diagram between people who use tiling window managers and people who know Haskell is just a circle.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In complete good spirit, it’s worth mentioning <a href=\"https://i3wm.org/\">i3</a> was written largely <em>because</em> the developers thought XMonad was cool, but didn’t want to learn Haskell.</p>\n<p>After the presentation I was told by one of the LUG members that Tom’s talk was really inspiring for them. The student said <q>It’s really great seeing industry leaders and finding out they’re just like us - only maybe a bit older or more knowledgeable - and feeling like I can be just like that, too, if I just work hard and dedicate myself.</q></p>\n<p>It’s that kind of thing that makes me so glad I stuck with CNULUG. Even through all the lows, the awful turnout for the first year or so, we’ve pulled through - and now we matter so much that we’re making a real difference in students’ lives. Those sort of results, to me, almost makes my whole four years at CNU worth it on their own.</p>\n</section>\n<section id=\"pcse-coding-challenge\" class=\"level2\">\n<h2>PCSE Coding Challenge</h2>\n<p>A team I was on (with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pub/wilson-ho/82/33/b23\">Wilson Ho</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pub/ian-miller/b1/ba9/513\">Ian Miller</a>) won my university’s <q>PCSE Coding Challenge</q> on April 3. That was fun. I totally embarrassed myself during the big-wig ACM programming competition last semester, so it’s relieving to see some sort of quantifiable progress.</p>\n<p>Something struck me about the <a href=\"http://www.nathantypanski.com/files/2015Spring-PCSE-coding-challenge-Koehl.pdf\">problems</a>, though. We had three language options: Java, C (<code>gcc</code> with default flags), and C++ (<code>g++</code> with default flags). At least two of these would be more well-suited to scripting languages, though.</p>\n<p>Problem 4 is simple text substitution. The input two lines forming a substitution table (preceded by a less-than-helpful count), followed by a list of plaintext/cyphertext blocks:</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>3\na b c\nB C D\n2\nPT: abc\nCT: BCDDCB</code></pre>\n<p>You’re supposed to encrypt the plaintext blocks, and decrypt the cyphertext blocks.

My team solved the above text translation problem and the Sudoku problem (problem 3). Neither of those are particularly difficult, or require any sort of serious algorithms knowledge to solve. They’re more like run-of-the-mill programming challenges. We were about 90% of the way through problem 2, another simple text processing/sorting problem, when the timer rang.</p>\n<p>Main lesson learned: brush up on I/O in whatever language I’m choosing before the next algorithms competition. We could have performed a <em>lot</em> better if we spent less time fumbling around with a <code>BufferedReader</code> and more time thinking about algorithms.</p>\n</section>\n<section id=\"mike-bland-cnu-research-google-and-the-us-government\" class=\"level2\">\n<h2>Mike Bland, CNU research, Google, and the US Government</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://mike-bland.com/\">Mike Bland</a> keynoted <a href=\"http://cnu.edu/research/about/paideia.asp\">Paideia</a>, CNU’s annual <q>research conference</q> on April 11. He gave a primer of his talk, itself a sort of toned-down variation of his slideshow behemoth <a href=\"https://18f.gsa.gov/2014/12/11/large-scale-development-culture-change/\">Large Scale Development Culture Change: Google and the US Government</a> to the PCSE department on Friday, April 10. Apparently no one told him that the April 10 event would be a <q>talk</q>, and not a Q&amp;A, so Mike just ran through the same slides he’d be covering at Paideia.</p>\n<p>Mike really did a great job relating to the audience at the keynote. Even though he covered somewhat technical material, I think everyone who was there (mostly non-programmers) managed to relate to his talk and took him seriously. He made <a href=\"https://18f.gsa.gov/\">18F</a> seem like <em>the real deal</em>, where Google was just like the training grounds for work that will have real, lasting impact on the United States.</p>\n<p>One unfortunate consequence of Friday’s talk was that PCSE folks were notably absent on Saturday. In some sense that’s OK because they already saw most of it on Friday, but in another sense it’s not since Mike was quite obviously more well-prepared on Saturday.</p>\n<p>Mike is locally famous for organizing student demonstrations to <q>save</q>, from bureaucratic shutdown, CNU’s <a href=\"http://cnu.edu/academics/graduate/\">graduate program</a>, which basically makes him the reason I can write <q>Christopher Newport University</q> on my resumé instead of <q>Christopher Newport College</q>. But he was actually <em>confused</em> why he was relevant when <a href=\"http://www.pcs.cnu.edu/~David.Gore/\">Dr.&nbsp;Gore</a> asked him to keynote CNU’s undergraduate/graduate research conference.

I took an internship with Palantir this summer, on their Mission Operations team, instead of taking the <q>safe</q> route taking a full-time offer (like I might have gotten with <a href=\"https://www.ssaihq.com/\">SSAI</a>, who have given me arguably the most rewarding work experience of my lifetime applying bleeding-edge industry practices to the US government). As apprehensive as this leaves me, I’m really excited about joining Palantir.</p>\n<p>Why? I really can’t overstate the influence of the mission ops team lead in inspiring me to do this. Paraphrasing, this guy told me upfront:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You seem good, but you’re kind of green. There are specific things about Linux that you didn’t know - out of genuine ignorance - and our goal is gonna be to teach you those things, so you’re capable enough to do your day-to-day tasks with us and not need support from anyone else. You’re not on the level we need <em>quite</em> yet, and that’s why we’re offering you an internship, but my goal is going to be to <em>get</em> you there and <em>make</em> you that good so you can succeed with us.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now, to understand why that kind of talk inspires me, you’ve gotta understand something about who I am. I’m naturally a bit arrogant. I founded the Linux user group at my school, and I built my first Arch system seven years ago with nothing but a paper printout of the <a href=\"https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Beginners%27_guide\">beginner’s guide</a> and a single desktop computer. I’ve been administering my own webservers for three years, and running other people’s Linux servers for money for two. At least among my peers at CNU, I’m simply <em>not used</em> to people knowing more than me about this operating system.</p>\n<p>But the people at Palantir are better than me. They showed me up in the interview process, but it’s not just that - being smart isn’t the only requirement to win my respect - they’re willing to teach me. And that kind of attitude is what makes me fall in love with a company.</p>\n<p>I’ll quote <a href=\"http://dcurt.is/the-compounding-returns-of-intelligence\">one of their cofounders, Stephen Cohen</a>, to drive this point home:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We tend to massively underestimate the compounding returns of intelligence. As humans, we need to solve big problems. If you graduate Stanford at 22 and Google recruits you, you’ll work a 9-to-5. It’s probably more like an 11-to-3 in terms of hard work. They’ll pay well. It’s relaxing. But what they are actually doing is paying you to accept a much lower intellectual growth rate. When you recognize that intelligence is compounding, the cost of that missing long-term compounding is enormous. They’re not giving you the best opportunity of your life. Then a scary thing can happen: You might realize one day that you’ve lost your competitive edge. You won’t be the best anymore. You won’t be able to fall in love with new stuff. Things are cushy where you are. You get complacent and stall. So, run your prospective engineering hires through that narrative. Then show them the alternative: working at your startup.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</section>\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn1\"><p>Physics, computer science, and engineering.<a href=\"http://www.nathantypanski.com/blog/2015-04-15-heads-down-for-the-finish-line.html#fnref1\">↩</a></p></li>\n<li id=\"fn2\"><p>To be fair, the C solution isn’t much worse:</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode C\"><code class=\"sourceCode c\"><span class=\"ot\">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"ot\">#include &lt;string.h&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"ot\">#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</span>\n\n<span class=\"ot\">#define MAX_LINE 512</span>\n\n<span class=\"dt\">int</span> main() {\n        <span class=\"dt\">char</span> *line = malloc(<span class=\"kw\">sizeof</span>(<span class=\"dt\">char</span>) * MAX_LINE);\n        <span class=\"dt\">int</span> count = <span class=\"dv\">0</span>;\n        <span class=\"kw\">do</span> {\n                scanf(<span class=\"st\">\"%d</span><span class=\"ch\">\\n</span><span class=\"st\">\"</span>, &amp;count);\n                <span class=\"dt\">char</span> *pt = malloc(<span class=\"kw\">sizeof</span>(<span class=\"dt\">char</span>) * count + <span class=\"dv\">1</span>);\n                <span class=\"dt\">char</span> *ct = malloc(<span class=\"kw\">sizeof</span>(<span class=\"dt\">char</span>) * count + <span class=\"dv\">1</span>);\n\n                <span class=\"dt\">int</span> i;\n                <span class=\"kw\">for</span>(i = <span class=\"dv\">0</span>; i &lt; count; i++)\n                        scanf(<span class=\"st\">\"%c \"</span>, pt + i);\n                <span class=\"kw\">for</span>(i = <span class=\"dv\">0</span>; i &lt; count; i++)\n                        scanf(<span class=\"st\">\"%c \"</span>, ct + i);\n\n                scanf(<span class=\"st\">\"%d \"</span>, &amp;count);\n\n                <span class=\"kw\">for</span>(i = <span class=\"dv\">0</span>; i &lt; count; i++) {\n                        <span class=\"dt\">char</span> *left;\n                        <span class=\"dt\">char</span> *right;\n                        fgets(line, MAX_LINE, stdin);\n                        <span class=\"kw\">if</span> (line[<span class=\"dv\">0</span>] == 'P') {\n                                left = pt;\n                                right = ct;\n                                printf(<span class=\"st\">\"CT: \"</span>);\n                        } <span class=\"kw\">else</span> {\n                                left = ct;\n                                right = pt;\n                                printf(<span class=\"st\">\"PT: \"</span>);\n                        }\n                        <span class=\"dt\">int</span> j;\n                        <span class=\"kw\">for</span>(j = <span class=\"dv\">4</span>; line[j] != <span class=\"ch\">'\\n'</span>; j++) {\n                                <span class=\"dt\">int</span> k;\n                                <span class=\"kw\">for</span>(k = <span class=\"dv\">0</span>; left[k] != line[j]; k++);\n                                printf(<span class=\"st\">\"%c\"</span>, right[k]);\n                        }\n                        printf(<span class=\"st\">\"</span><span class=\"ch\">\\n</span><span class=\"st\">\"</span>);\n                }\n                free(pt);\n                free(ct);\n        } <span class=\"kw\">while</span> (count != <span class=\"dv\">0</span>);\n        free(line);\n        <span class=\"kw\">return</span> <span class=\"dv\">0</span>;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>But there’s a bug in the official test data, and that code won’t work unless the following is fixed:</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>-5\n+7\n d e h l o r w\n H J L O Q T V</code></pre>\n<a href=\"http://www.nathantypanski.com/blog/2015-04-15-heads-down-for-the-finish-line.html#fnref2\">↩</a></li>\n</ol>\n</section>",

I think I read <a href=\"http://www.jwz.org/gruntle/nscpdorm.html\">the netscape dorm</a> three times in the last few weeks.

That was awesome. I don’t think anything could validate a newly-founded Linux user group more than having industry leaders come joke with you about tiling window managers. Quoting Tom:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The venn diagram between people who use tiling window managers and people who know Haskell is just a circle.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In complete good spirit, it’s worth mentioning <a href=\"https://i3wm.org/\">i3</a> was written largely <em>because</em> the developers thought XMonad was cool, but didn’t want to learn Haskell.</p>\n<p>After the presentation I was told by one of the LUG members that Tom’s talk was really inspiring for them. The student said <q>It’s really great seeing industry leaders and finding out they’re just like us - only maybe a bit older or more knowledgeable - and feeling like I can be just like that, too, if I just work hard and dedicate myself.</q></p>\n<p>It’s that kind of thing that makes me so glad I stuck with CNULUG. Even through all the lows, the awful turnout for the first year or so, we’ve pulled through - and now we matter so much that we’re making a real difference in students’ lives. Those sort of results, to me, almost makes my whole four years at CNU worth it on their own.</p>\n</section>\n<section id=\"pcse-coding-challenge\" class=\"level2\">\n<h2>PCSE Coding Challenge</h2>\n<p>A team I was on (with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pub/wilson-ho/82/33/b23\">Wilson Ho</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pub/ian-miller/b1/ba9/513\">Ian Miller</a>) won my university’s <q>PCSE Coding Challenge</q> on April 3.

My team solved the above text translation problem and the Sudoku problem (problem 3). Neither of those are particularly difficult, or require any sort of serious algorithms knowledge to solve. They’re more like run-of-the-mill programming challenges. We were about 90% of the way through problem 2, another simple text processing/sorting problem, when the timer rang.</p>\n<p>Main lesson learned: brush up on I/O in whatever language I’m choosing before the next algorithms competition.

I took an internship with Palantir this summer, on their Mission Operations team, instead of taking the <q>safe</q> route taking a full-time offer (like I might have gotten with <a href=\"https://www.ssaihq.com/\">SSAI</a>, who have given me arguably the most rewarding work experience of my lifetime applying bleeding-edge industry practices to the US government). As apprehensive as this leaves me, I’m really excited about joining Palantir.</p>\n<p>Why? I really can’t overstate the influence of the mission ops team lead in inspiring me to do this. Paraphrasing, this guy told me upfront:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You seem good, but you’re kind of green. There are specific things about Linux that you didn’t know - out of genuine ignorance - and our goal is gonna be to teach you those things, so you’re capable enough to do your day-to-day tasks with us and not need support from anyone else. You’re not on the level we need <em>quite</em> yet, and that’s why we’re offering you an internship, but my goal is going to be to <em>get</em> you there and <em>make</em> you that good so you can succeed with us.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now, to understand why that kind of talk inspires me, you’ve gotta understand something about who I am. I’m naturally a bit arrogant. I founded the Linux user group at my school, and I built my first Arch system seven years ago with nothing but a paper printout of the <a href=\"https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Beginners%27_guide\">beginner’s guide</a> and a single desktop computer. I’ve been administering my own webservers for three years, and running other people’s Linux servers for money for two. At least among my peers at CNU, I’m simply <em>not used</em> to people knowing more than me about this operating system.</p>\n<p>But the people at Palantir are better than me. They showed me up in the interview process, but it’s not just that - being smart isn’t the only requirement to win my respect - they’re willing to teach me. And that kind of attitude is what makes me fall in love with a company.</p>\n<p>I’ll quote <a href=\"http://dcurt.is/the-compounding-returns-of-intelligence\">one of their cofounders, Stephen Cohen</a>, to drive this point home:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We tend to massively underestimate the compounding returns of intelligence. As humans, we need to solve big problems. If you graduate Stanford at 22 and Google recruits you, you’ll work a 9-to-5. It’s probably more like an 11-to-3 in terms of hard work. They’ll pay well. It’s relaxing. But what they are actually doing is paying you to accept a much lower intellectual growth rate. When you recognize that intelligence is compounding, the cost of that missing long-term compounding is enormous. They’re not giving you the best opportunity of your life. Then a scary thing can happen: You might realize one day that you’ve lost your competitive edge. You won’t be the best anymore. You won’t be able to fall in love with new stuff. Things are cushy where you are. You get complacent and stall. So, run your prospective engineering hires through that narrative. Then show them the alternative: working at your startup.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</section>\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn1\"><p>Physics, computer science, and engineering.<a href=\"http://www.nathantypanski.com/blog/2015-04-15-heads-down-for-the-finish-line.html#fnref1\">↩</a></p></li>\n<li id=\"fn2\"><p>To be fair, the C solution isn’t much worse:</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode C\"><code class=\"sourceCode c\"><span class=\"ot\">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"ot\">#include &lt;string.h&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"ot\">#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</span>\n\n<span class=\"ot\">#define MAX_LINE 512</span>\n\n<span class=\"dt\">int</span> main() {\n        <span class=\"dt\">char</span> *line = malloc(<span class=\"kw\">sizeof</span>(<span class=\"dt\">char</span>) * MAX_LINE);\n        <span class=\"dt\">int</span> count = <span class=\"dv\">0</span>;\n        <span class=\"kw\">do</span> {\n                scanf(<span class=\"st\">\"%d</span><span class=\"ch\">\\n</span><span class=\"st\">\"</span>, &amp;count);\n                <span class=\"dt\">char</span> *pt = malloc(<span class=\"kw\">sizeof</span>(<span class=\"dt\">char</span>) * count + <span class=\"dv\">1</span>);\n                <span class=\"dt\">char</span> *ct = malloc(<span class=\"kw\">sizeof</span>(<span class=\"dt\">char</span>) * count + <span class=\"dv\">1</span>);\n\n                <span class=\"dt\">int</span> i;\n                <span class=\"kw\">for</span>(i = <span class=\"dv\">0</span>; i &lt; count; i++)\n                        scanf(<span class=\"st\">\"%c \"</span>, pt + i);\n                <span class=\"kw\">for</span>(i = <span class=\"dv\">0</span>; i &lt; count; i++)\n                        scanf(<span class=\"st\">\"%c \"</span>, ct + i);\n\n                scanf(<span class=\"st\">\"%d \"</span>, &amp;count);\n\n                <span class=\"kw\">for</span>(i = <span class=\"dv\">0</span>; i &lt; count; i++) {\n                        <span class=\"dt\">char</span> *left;\n                        <span class=\"dt\">char</span> *right;\n                        fgets(line, MAX_LINE, stdin);\n                        <span class=\"kw\">if</span> (line[<span class=\"dv\">0</span>] == 'P') {\n                                left = pt;\n                                right = ct;\n                                printf(<span class=\"st\">\"CT: \"</span>);\n                        } <span class=\"kw\">else</span> {\n                                left = ct;\n                                right = pt;\n                                printf(<span class=\"st\">\"PT: \"</span>);\n                        }\n                        <span class=\"dt\">int</span> j;\n                        <span class=\"kw\">for</span>(j = <span class=\"dv\">4</span>; line[j] != <span class=\"ch\">'\\n'</span>; j++) {\n                                <span class=\"dt\">int</span> k;\n                                <span class=\"kw\">for</span>(k = <span class=\"dv\">0</span>; left[k] != line[j]; k++);\n                                printf(<span class=\"st\">\"%c\"</span>, right[k]);\n                        }\n                        printf(<span class=\"st\">\"</span><span class=\"ch\">\\n</span><span class=\"st\">\"</span>);\n                }\n                free(pt);\n                free(ct);\n        } <span class=\"kw\">while</span> (count != <span class=\"dv\">0</span>);\n        free(line);\n        <span class=\"kw\">return</span> <span class=\"dv\">0</span>;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>But there’s a bug in the official test data, and that code won’t work unless the following is fixed:</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>-5\n+7\n d e h l o r w\n H J L O Q T V</code></pre>\n<a href=\"http://www.nathantypanski.com/blog/2015-04-15-heads-down-for-the-finish-line.html#fnref2\">↩</a></li>\n</ol>\n</section>",

The gist of it is this: there are signal variants, and you create them by writing a letter that serves as a key. Each key has two variants: a half-duration lowercase one and a full-duration uppercase one.</p>\n<p>So to make the clock signal in the PCI read diagram, it’s 18 half-duration clock cycles, and we write that <code>18{c}</code>. The brackets there aren’t strictly necessary, but you can write them for clarity. Signal changes are separated by spaces if there’s any ambiguity about what argument goes with what transition.</p>\n<p>In the above example, I used these letters to make the signals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>C</code>/<code>c</code>: clock</li>\n<li><code>U</code>/<code>u</code>: unknown</li>\n<li><code>D</code>/<code>d</code>: multiple values</li>\n<li><code>H</code>/<code>h</code>: hi</li>\n<li><code>L</code>/<code>l</code>: lo</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The other interesting option is including letters in the <code>D</code> timings. The way you do that is you add an argument in brackets following a <code>D</code> block, like <code>D{0000}</code> to draw a multi-signal timing with value <code>0000</code>.</p>\n<p>For invalid states I used <code>X</code> in the below example:</p>\n</section>\n<section id=\"pci-interrupt-acknowledge\" class=\"level2\">\n<h2>PCI Interrupt Acknowledge</h2>\n<p>When a PCI interrupt acknowledge starts, you have invalid values in the address/data line. They’re <em>knowable</em>, but it’s against the protocol to use them for anything. To show that I used an <code>X</code>, which draws a red line for an <em>undefined</em> don’t care. Or at least that’s how I interpreted it. Some people will just use shaded blocks for everything, and make no distinction between the two.</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"http://www.nathantypanski.com/files/latex/tikz-timing/pci-int-thumb.png\" alt=\"PCI interrupt acknowledge.

I added the <code>DEVSEL#</code> signal myself,<a href=\"http://www.nathantypanski.com/blog/2014-10-29-tikz-timing.html#fn2\" class=\"footnoteRef\" id=\"fnref2\"><sup>2</sup></a> and I’ve taken some slight liberties with the start and stop times of the signals (though they should still be accurate). One notable feature lacking in my diagrams is the delay cycles—most books you’ll read on PCI, in addition to the spec itself will include those directly on the diagram. I haven’t figured out how to do that kind of thing yet.</p>\n<section id=\"pci-read\" class=\"level2\">\n<h2>PCI Read</h2>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"http://www.nathantypanski.com/files/latex/tikz-timing/pci-read-thumb.png\" alt=\"PCI read operation.

The gist of it is this: there are signal variants, and you create them by writing a letter that serves as a key. Each key has two variants: a half-duration lowercase one and a full-duration uppercase one.</p>\n<p>So to make the clock signal in the PCI read diagram, it’s 18 half-duration clock cycles, and we write that <code>18{c}</code>. The brackets there aren’t strictly necessary, but you can write them for clarity. Signal changes are separated by spaces if there’s any ambiguity about what argument goes with what transition.</p>\n<p>In the above example, I used these letters to make the signals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>C</code>/<code>c</code>: clock</li>\n<li><code>U</code>/<code>u</code>: unknown</li>\n<li><code>D</code>/<code>d</code>: multiple values</li>\n<li><code>H</code>/<code>h</code>: hi</li>\n<li><code>L</code>/<code>l</code>: lo</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The other interesting option is including letters in the <code>D</code> timings. The way you do that is you add an argument in brackets following a <code>D</code> block, like <code>D{0000}</code> to draw a multi-signal timing with value <code>0000</code>.</p>\n<p>For invalid states I used <code>X</code> in the below example:</p>\n</section>\n<section id=\"pci-interrupt-acknowledge\" class=\"level2\">\n<h2>PCI Interrupt Acknowledge</h2>\n<p>When a PCI interrupt acknowledge starts, you have invalid values in the address/data line.

Or at least that’s how I interpreted it. Some people will just use shaded blocks for everything, and make no distinction between the two.</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"http://www.nathantypanski.com/files/latex/tikz-timing/pci-int-thumb.png\" alt=\"PCI interrupt acknowledge.

It’s fairly high-level, however, and doesn’t cover the nitty-gritty: all those long, painful hours spent trying to smash Emacs into reasonable keybindings are lost. You get the retrospective, the analysis, but not the same benefit of hindsight I’ve gathered since I switched. Unfortunately, there aren’t many resources out there on how to do this <em>right</em>. People use Emacs. It’s a tool. Most of its users don’t write about it, and the percentage of Emacs users who try to emulate Vim and also write about it is even smaller.</p>\n<p>There is <a href=\"http://bling.github.io/\">Bling</a>, the vim-airline developer, who switched and ultimately convinced me to give Emacs a shot. But his tips just scratch the surface of what’s necessary to replicate the finger-friendliness of a modern Vim workflow.</p>\n<p>It’s a well-known and overstated joke that the default Emacs bindings are bad. If you’re reading this post, you probably already agree with me here, but for the uninitiated: key combos are the devil. Any time you are pressing two keys at once, with the same hand, hundreds of times per day, you are setting yourself up for repetitive stress injury. As programmers, we need to take care of our hands or our careers will be over.</p>\n<p>This is going to be part-tutorial, part describing my configuration. With a little determination, this can take you from ground-zero to a working Evil configuration and generic development environment.</p>\n<p>This post is geared at the <strong>determined Vim user</strong> who is willing to give Evil a shot and likes having a heavily customized editor. It has a number of tasks that are intended to teach the right attitude and mindset required to keep working with Emacs on your own. These will get you familiar enough with reading documentation that you know where to look when you want to do something. It is also Elisp-focused, with no emphasis on the more <q>modern</q> customization features of Emacs that ultimately prevent new users from groking its internals.</p>\n<section id=\"first-some-terminology\" class=\"level2\">\n<h2>First, some terminology</h2>\n<p>When you first fire up Emacs, you need to learn how they reference certain objects and keybindings. This is pretty simple, but can be confusing if you don’t have the initial introduction.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>M-x</code> means <q>press the <code>&lt;ALT&gt;</code> key, then press <code>x</code> while still holding that down</q>. This brings up the Emacs command prompt, which gives you access to any of the functions that are declared <strong>interactive</strong> - that is, Elisp functions that may be run interactively by the user.</li>\n<li>If someone gives you a command sequence like <code>M-x package-install &lt;RET&gt; evil &lt;RET&gt;</code>, that means to do the <code>M-x</code> keybinding, type <code>package-install</code>, press enter, then type <code>evil</code> and press enter. Often the second <code>&lt;RET&gt;</code> will be omitted and taken as implicit.</li>\n<li>A <strong>buffer</strong> is a place where text may go. This is distinct from a <strong>window</strong> which is a visual area on screen which displays a buffer.</li>\n<li>A <strong>frame</strong> is another Emacs window in your window manager that is attached to the same Emacs process.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That’s it for the basics. Let’s see where we can go from here.</p>\n</section>\n<section id=\"package-archives\" class=\"level2\">\n<h2>Package archives</h2>\n<p>In order to install packages from things besides the default repos, you need to define a variable called <code>package-archives</code> with the URLs of the package sources in it. You do this in your <code>init.el</code> file, which is located at <code>~/.emacs.d/init.el</code> by default.</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>(setq package-archives '((\"melpa\" . \"http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/\")\n                         (\"org\" . \"http://orgmode.org/elpa/\")\n                         (\"gnu\" . \"http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/\")))</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"http://melpa.milkbox.net/\">MELPA</a> is the most important source for up-to-date Emacs packages. It’s kind of like the <a href=\"http://www.nathantypanski.com/blog/2014-07-25-all-your-daemons.html\">Arch Linux</a> of Emacs package archives - it builds directly from upstream all the time, and it works with the builtin Emacs package manager.</p>\n<p>Also, below the above code, you’ll need to initialize the package manager.</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>(require 'package)\n(package-initialize)</code></pre>\n<p>Once you’ve added the above to that file, you can evaluate each of these expressions inside Emacs with <code>C-x C-e</code>. To evaluate an expression, position the cursor outside and following the expression and hit that keybinding. This runs the command <code>eval-last-sexp</code>, which evaluates the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression\">symbolic expression</a> before your cursor and pretty-prints the output.</p>\n<p>You’ll need to do this in order (i.e., evaluate the <code>setq</code> expression first), or it won’t work.</p>\n<section id=\"installing-evil\" class=\"level3\">\n<h3>Installing Evil</h3>\n<p>Once the above is finished, you can install <code>evil-mode</code> with <code>M-x package-install &lt;RET&gt; evil &lt;RET&gt;</code>. The compilation log that pops up at the bottom of the screen can be killed with <code>C-x 4 0</code>. That runs the function <code>kill-buffer-and-window</code>, which you can also call interactively at the <code>M-x</code> prompt. More on that later.</p>\n<p>After that, Evil will be installed into the <code>~/.emacs.d</code> directory. To enable it, type <code>M-x evil-mode</code>. Now all your Vim bindings work, as long as you don’t kill Emacs.</p>\n<p>You probably want to enable Evil more permanently. Add the following to the bottom of your <code>~/.emacs.d/init.el</code> file:</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>(require 'evil)\n(evil-mode 1)</code></pre>\n<p>This will automatically enable <code>evil-mode</code> every time you start Emacs. It’s important that it goes at the bottom of the file. Evil relies on starting up after the rest of your packages, so that it can detect them and overlay its keybindings appropriately.</p>\n<p>If you break your configuration, restart Emacs with:</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>$ emacs --debug-init</code></pre>\n<p>to get debug information on your init files. Don’t feel bad if you have to use Vim to fix them in the meantime. Don’t get worried thinking Evil is not a <q>first-class citizen</q> in Emacs: this is an editor built to be ripped to pieces by the competent user.</p>\n<p>The interesting part of Emacs is its Lisp engine. It’s the scores of reusable functions for automating your interaction with code. Keybindings are just one way of calling these things.</p>\n</section>\n</section>\n<section id=\"modes\" class=\"level2\">\n<h2>Modes</h2>\n<p>Like Vim, Emacs uses the word <q>modes</q> to refer to an element of state in its editor. Unlike Vim, this is not referring to <em>modal editing</em>, but rather to the composition of various modules that make up your current editing environment.</p>\n<p>A <strong>major mode</strong> defines your primary interaction with a buffer in Emacs. There can only be one of these active at once, and they are not all necessarily for editing text. For example, <code>dired</code> is a major mode for editing directories, and <code>magit</code> is a Git interaction interface. An important major mode to be aware of is <code>fundamental mode</code>, which is a major mode with no discerning features besides the ability to type text into a buffer.</p>\n<p><strong>Minor modes</strong> are compositional - there can be more than one of them, and minor modes loaded after others can override the settings of a previous one. Evil is one such example of a minor mode.</p>\n<section id=\"states\" class=\"level4\">\n<h4>States</h4>\n<p>Evil uses the term <em>state</em> to refer to what Vim calls a <q>mode</q>. There are more states than these, but here are a few to get you going:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>evil-emacs-state</code><a href=\"http://www.nathantypanski.com/blog/2014-08-03-a-vim-like-emacs-config.html#fn1\" class=\"footnoteRef\" id=\"fnref1\"><sup>1</sup></a></li>\n<li><code>evil-insert-state</code></li>\n<li><code>evil-normal-state</code></li>\n<li><code>evil-visual-state</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each of these can be called interactively with <code>M-x</code> to enable them. The way Evil works is each of these states is bound to a different keymap, and those keymaps change the meanings of your keys to call different functions when they are pressed. This affords you the ability to remap bindings across different states, where they will only work when <code>evil-mode</code> is enabled and Evil is also in the right state to activate the keymap.</p>\n<p>Use <code>ESC</code>, <code>i</code>, <code>v</code>, etc. as you would in Vim to switch between Evil states. Then play around with using <code>M-x</code> to toggle the different states before moving on.</p>\n</section>\n</section>\n<section id=\"binding-keys\" class=\"level2\">\n<h2>Binding keys</h2>\n<p>Let’s get started by adding some bindings to Evil. We want switching between windows to be easy, so we can bind the following:</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>(define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd \"C-h\") 'evil-window-left)\n(define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd \"C-j\") 'evil-window-down)\n(define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd \"C-k\") 'evil-window-up)\n(define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd \"C-l\") 'evil-window-right)</code></pre>\n<p>This binds <code>&lt;CTRL&gt;-hjkl</code> to window movement commands when Evil is in normal state.</p>\n<p>There are a number of interesting things about these expressions. First, position your cursor over the word <code>define-key</code> and call <code>M-x describe-function</code>. It will provide the default value of the thing under your cursor, so you can just press <code>RET</code> again to bring up a buffer with help information. Read the help information it gives you, then move on. The buffer that appears will be in <code>help-mode</code>, which does not have Evil bindings, but you can use <code>q</code> to close it and keep working.</p>\n<p>The proper term in Emacs for <q>your cursor</q> would be <strong>point</strong>. This is used extensively in the help documentation, so it’s worth remembering. The <q>thing</q> at point that provided the default argument for <code>describe-function</code> was a <strong>symbol</strong>.<a href=\"http://www.nathantypanski.com/blog/2014-08-03-a-vim-like-emacs-config.html#fn2\" class=\"footnoteRef\" id=\"fnref2\"><sup>2</sup></a> A symbol is basically any thing in Emacs Lisp which has a <em>name</em> and can be hashed into a lookup table, where it then becomes an <strong>object</strong> in Lisp. These objects could be anything: functions, data, or text, for example, but symbols are interesting because we can give them names and refer to them later somehow.</p>\n<p>From the <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Symbols.html\">official manual</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You can test whether an arbitrary Lisp object is a symbol with <code>symbolp</code>:</p>\n<p>— Function: <strong>symbolp</strong> <em>object</em></p>\n<p>This function returns <code>t</code> if <em>object</em> is a symbol, <code>nil</code> otherwise.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now, use <code>M-x apropos RET point RET</code> and skim through the list that pops up. If you have Evil working properly, you can use <code>:q</code> to close that window when you’re done with it.</p>\n<section id=\"quoting\" class=\"level3\">\n<h3>Quoting</h3>\n<p>Readers with keen eyes may have noticed that one of the arguments in the above code has an apostrophe (<code>'</code>) before it. This is because <code>evil-window-left</code> is a function’s name, and we want to be able to call it later by binding it to a key. Putting an apostrophe before it when passing it as an argument to a function means we’re passing the <strong>quoted</strong> form of <code>evil-window-left</code> to <code>define-key</code>, not what it evaluates to.</p>\n<p>Since our intent is to pass the <em>symbol</em> <code>'evil-window-left</code> into <code>define-key</code>, and not the evaluated form of <code>evil-window-left</code> itself, this is the right thing to do.</p>\n<p>All arguments in Elisp expressions, without quoting, will be evaluated before they are passed into a function call. Quoting lets us avoid that and pass their symbols instead.</p>\n</section>\n<section id=\"maps-and-keys\" class=\"level3\">\n<h3>Maps and keys</h3>\n<p>The two other arguments to each of those keybindings were unquoted. The keymap, <code>evil-normal-state-map</code>, goes directly into the function, since the purpose of <code>define-key</code> is to modify that map. The expression <code>(kbd \"C-h\")</code> is actually another separate function call that happens before the outside expression is evaluated. If we use <code>M-x describe-function</code> to look at the help documentation for <code>kbd</code>, we see:</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>kbd is a compiled Lisp function in `subr.el'.\n\n(kbd KEYS)\n\nConvert KEYS to the internal Emacs key representation.\nKEYS should be a string constant in the format used for\nsaving keyboard macros (see `edmacro-mode').</code></pre>\n<p>We need to use the <code>kbd</code> function to describe our keybindings, since they contain an extra operator (the <code>&lt;CTRL&gt;</code> key). While single character bindings can be looked up in keymaps directly, a key sequence like <code>C-h</code> is not stored in the map in that form.</p>\n<p>You can look at the value of <code>(kbd \"C-h\")</code> by typing it on a line below those bindings, and then evaluating it with <code>C-x C-e</code> as before. In the <strong>minibuffer</strong>, the text area with a blank line at the bottom of the screen, <code>\"^H\"</code> is displayed. That tells you that the expression</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>(define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd \"C-h\") 'evil-window-left)</code></pre>\n<p>is internally binding <code>\"^H\"</code> to <code>evil-window-left</code>, but don’t doing that yourself—the way it’s shown in the minibuffer is still a <em>displayed form</em>, which is different from the hashed value it eventually becomes.</p>\n</section>\n</section>\n<section id=\"lisp-navigation\" class=\"level2\">\n<h2>Lisp navigation</h2>\n<p>Accessing help documentation using <code>M-x describe-function</code> is pretty awesome, but the interface for doing it is fairly clunky. We can make it better using <code>elisp-sime-nav-mode</code>, the <a href=\"http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/\">superior Lisp interaction mode</a> for Emacs. You can install it with <code>M-x package-install RET elisp-slime-nav</code>.</p>\n<p>Slime mode needs to be enabled for it to be used. To do this, we will define a function that we’ll tie to the hook for <code>emacs-lisp-mode</code>. A <strong>hook</strong> is a function that gets evaluated when something predefined happens in your editor. Most modes have hooks already configured, and all you will need to do is add functions to call with them using <code>add-hook</code> for them to become useful.</p>\n<p>First we <code>require</code> the package <code>elisp-slime-nav</code>, which ensures that it is loaded when Emacs starts:</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>(require 'elisp-slime-nav)</code></pre>\n<p>Then we define our function:<a href=\"http://www.nathantypanski.com/blog/2014-08-03-a-vim-like-emacs-config.html#fn3\" class=\"footnoteRef\" id=\"fnref3\"><sup>3</sup></a></p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>(defun my-lisp-hook ()\n  (elisp-slime-nav-mode)\n  (turn-on-eldoc-mode)\n  )</code></pre>\n<p>Add that into your init file after the <code>require</code> call. Note that the function definition is prefixed by <code>my-</code>. While not all Emacs packages do this, Elisp does not have namespaces like Python or Ruby does. To counteract this, convention is to define all of your functions prefixed by your package name, and for personal code using <code>my-</code> is not uncommon.</p>\n<p>Then, we add it to to the <code>emacs-lisp-mode-hook</code> using <code>add-hook</code>:</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>(add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'my-lisp-hook)</code></pre>\n<p>This makes <code>elisp-slime-nav-mode</code> and <code>turn-on-eldoc-mode</code><a href=\"http://www.nathantypanski.com/blog/2014-08-03-a-vim-like-emacs-config.html#fn4\" class=\"footnoteRef\" id=\"fnref4\"><sup>4</sup></a> get called every time <code>emacs-lisp-mode</code> is enabled. Now go ahead and evaluate these with <code>C-x C-e</code>. To make this easier, you can surround the block in a <code>(progn)</code>, which makes the whole thing get treated as one big expression for evaluation:</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>(progn\n  (require 'elisp-slime-nav)\n  (defun my-lisp-hook ()\n    (elisp-slime-nav-mode)\n    (turn-on-eldoc-mode)\n    )\n  (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'my-lisp-hook)\n)</code></pre>\n<p>While the <code>(progn)</code> here doesn’t serve any practical purpose, it might help you group blocks of code for evaluation while you’re hacking at them.</p>\n<p>Since <code>emacs-lisp-mode</code> is already running (you’re in a <code>.el</code> file), you can force your hook’s evaluation by typing <code>(my-lisp-hook)</code> into the buffer and evaluating it manually.</p>\n<p>You’ll notice that when you hover over functions now, <code>eldoc-mode</code> shows their signature in the minibuffer. If you want to see the help information like we’d been doing manually before, though, you still need to type <code>describe-function</code> into the <code>M-x</code> prompt. Now that we have Slime, we can simplify this with another keybinding:<a href=\"http://www.nathantypanski.com/blog/2014-08-03-a-vim-like-emacs-config.html#fn5\" class=\"footnoteRef\" id=\"fnref5\"><sup>5</sup></a></p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>(evil-define-key 'normal emacs-lisp-mode-map (kbd \"K\")\n  'elisp-slime-nav-describe-elisp-thing-at-point)</code></pre>\n<p>Evaluating the above will do contextual lookup on the thing at point whenever you press <code>K</code> in Evil’s normal state.</p>\n<p>The syntax here is different from when we defined the <a href=\"http://www.nathantypanski.com/blog/2014-08-03-a-vim-like-emacs-config.html#binding-keys\">window movement bindings</a> earlier. This is because we want to define <code>K</code> to call <code>elisp-slime-nav-describe-elisp-thing-at-point</code> only when we are in <code>emacs-lisp-mode-map</code> and Evil is in normal state. The <code>evil-define-key</code> function lets us do this, by providing arguments for both the Evil state and the keymap for the binding to be active in.</p>\n<p>Now you have the tools necessary to explore Emacs Lisp code without getting lost. Doing documentation lookups on everything you see that you don’t understand is a great way to start familiarizing yourself with Elisp code.</p>\n<p>Before we move on, lookup the descriptions for <code>progn</code>, <code>require</code>, <code>add-hook</code>, and <code>emacs-lisp-mode-hook</code> and read them. Don’t be afraid if you encounter words you don’t understand. Seeing the bigger picture in all the lingo takes time, but just doing this will help you start to understand it.</p>\n</section>\n<section id=\"managing-buffers\" class=\"level2\">\n<h2>Managing buffers</h2>\n<p>You can list the buffers that are currently open by typing <code>M-x list-buffers</code>. Using the bindings we defined earlier, you can switch to the window that is opened and hit <code>q</code> to close it when you’re done. To switch to one of these buffers, typing <code>M-x switch-to-buffer</code> will bring up a minibuffer prompt where you can type the name of a buffer to switch to it.</p>\n<p>For a better listing, you can use <code>M-x ibuffer</code>.</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"http://www.nathantypanski.com/images/2014-08-ibuffer.png\" alt=\"IBuffer with the default settings\"><figcaption>IBuffer with the default settings</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>The default bindings you should care about right now are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>n</code> and <code>p</code> to go to the next and previous buffers.</li>\n<li><code>d</code> (marking the buffer for deletion), then <code>x</code> on a buffer will make it go away.</li>\n<li><code>RET</code> while a buffer name is at point will take you to that buffer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>IBuffer has all sorts of useful features for browsing, filtering, and editing open buffers. But at least for a Vim user, its keybindings won’t at all be intuitive. Typing <code>j</code> accidentally will call <code>jump-to-buffer</code>, which is almost certainly not what you want. If you felt like typing the name of the buffer at a prompt, you probably wouldn’t have opened IBuffer to begin with!</p>\n<p>Aside from being unnatural for Vim users, the interface to IBuffer isn’t actually that bad. The keybindings are mostly single-key sequences, unlike more poorly-designed Emacs modes, and the functions allow for quick actions that will save you tons of work.</p>\n<section id=\"stealing-ibuffers-keymap\" class=\"level3\">\n<h3>Stealing IBuffer’s keymap</h3>\n<p>When I previously wrote about my experience switching to Evil, I mentioned there are a <a href=\"http://www.nathantypanski.com/blog/2014-07-02-switching-to-emacs.html#new-habits\">couple of different ways</a> to deal with major mode keymaps being inconsistent with Evil. I’ll be covering the full remapping approach here, since it has a few benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your major modes will be more tightly integrated with Evil.</li>\n<li>You’ll have the ability to redefine keys at will, easily and quickly.</li>\n<li>Remapping keys this way offers a chance at better understanding the functions in a major mode, which might just be missed otherwise. For core components of Emacs, like IBuffer and dired, building a more useful keymap can be a rewarding learning experience in itself.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With <code>ibuffer</code> open, type <code>M-x describe-mode</code> to pull up the help info below.</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"http://www.nathantypanski.com/images/2014-08-ibuffer-link.png\" alt=\"A link to ibuffer.el in help-mode\"><figcaption>A link to <code>ibuffer.el</code> in <code>help-mode</code></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Following that link<a href=\"http://www.nathantypanski.com/blog/2014-08-03-a-vim-like-emacs-config.html#fn6\" class=\"footnoteRef\" id=\"fnref6\"><sup>6</sup></a> will take you to the source code for IBuffer. Somewhere in there, you’ll find the keymap:</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"http://www.nathantypanski.com/images/2014-08-ibuffer-default-map.png\" alt=\"Default IBuffer keymap\"><figcaption>Default IBuffer keymap</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Any one of these major mode keymaps is bound to be really large, so I won’t reproduce it here. The idea is to redefine these into a map within Evil, so IBuffer will respect your Evil keymaps and still have its functionality. The <code>evil-define-key</code> function we used earlier has the option of taking an unlimited number of arguments. Now, copy lines like the following out of <code>ibuffer.el</code>:</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>(define-key map (kbd \"m\") 'ibuffer-mark-forward)\n(define-key map (kbd \"t\") 'ibuffer-toggle-marks)\n(define-key map (kbd \"u\") 'ibuffer-unmark-forward)\n(define-key map (kbd \"=\") 'ibuffer-diff-with-file)\n(define-key map (kbd \"j\") 'ibuffer-jump-to-buffer)\n(define-key map (kbd \"M-g\") 'ibuffer-jump-to-buffer)\n(define-key map (kbd \"M-s a C-s\") 'ibuffer-do-isearch)\n(define-key map (kbd \"M-s a M-C-s\") 'ibuffer-do-isearch-regexp)\n;; ...</code></pre>\n<p>and drop them into <code>~/.emacs.d/init.el</code>, after <code>(require 'evil)</code>, like follows:</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>(evil-define-key 'normal ibuffer-mode-map\n  (kbd \"m\") 'ibuffer-mark-forward\n  (kbd \"t\") 'ibuffer-toggle-marks\n  (kbd \"u\") 'ibuffer-unmark-forward\n  (kbd \"=\") 'ibuffer-diff-with-file\n  (kbd \"j\") 'ibuffer-jump-to-buffer\n  (kbd \"M-g\") 'ibuffer-jump-to-buffer\n  (kbd \"M-s a C-s\") 'ibuffer-do-isearch\n  (kbd \"M-s a M-C-s\") 'ibuffer-do-isearch-regexp\n  ;; ...\n  )</code></pre>\n<p>I used a Vim macro and visual block selection to do the rewrite into <code>evil-define-key</code> form for me, and it only took about a minute to perform.</p>\n<p>To ensure IBuffer will use Evil’s keybindings, add the line</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>(evil-set-initial-state 'ibuffer-mode 'normal)</code></pre>\n<p>to your init file. You can use this to set Evil’s initial state for any major mode - before you know what to bind in a mode, sometimes using Emacs state isn’t a bad idea.</p>\n<p>Now, if you try to actually use this configuration, it won’t work.<a href=\"http://www.nathantypanski.com/blog/2014-08-03-a-vim-like-emacs-config.html#fn7\" class=\"footnoteRef\" id=\"fnref7\"><sup>7</sup></a> The reason is we need to ensure the Evil bindings are not applied until <em>after</em> IBuffer is loaded, since it needs to do some special setup. The solution here is to surround the bindings in an <code>eval-after-load</code> block, like follows:</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>(eval-after-load 'ibuffer\n  '(progn\n     (evil-set-initial-state 'ibuffer-mode 'normal)\n     (evil-define-key 'normal ibuffer-mode-map\n       (kbd \"m\") 'ibuffer-mark-forward\n       (kbd \"t\") 'ibuffer-toggle-marks\n       (kbd \"u\") 'ibuffer-unmark-forward\n       (kbd \"=\") 'ibuffer-diff-with-file\n       (kbd \"j\") 'ibuffer-jump-to-buffer\n       (kbd \"M-g\") 'ibuffer-jump-to-buffer\n       (kbd \"M-s a C-s\") 'ibuffer-do-isearch\n       (kbd \"M-s a M-C-s\") 'ibuffer-do-isearch-regexp\n       ;; ...\n       )\n     )\n   )</code></pre>\n<p>This ensures your custom keymap does not try to set itself until after ibuffer has already initialized it properly.</p>\n<p>Your goal after this section is to read the help information for <code>eval-after-load</code>, as well as for some of the IBuffer bindings. Just pick ones that seem interesting, and again - don’t worry if you don’t understand things. Just read a few of them anyway.</p>\n<p>Once you’ve done your reading, get the custom keymap to work by evaluating the block with <code>C-x C-e</code>, and ensure it’s functional in <code>evil-normal-state</code> by calling <code>M-x evil-normal-state</code> manually within IBuffer.</p>\n</section>\n<section id=\"rebinding\" class=\"level3\">\n<h3>Rebinding</h3>\n<p>You might think it’s crazy to place all of this configuration in one lone init file. We’ll get to that in the next section. For now, keeping things in <code>init.el</code> will get the job done and let us focus on keybindings.</p>\n<p>The obvious thing to do, now that we’ve copied the keymap, is to add proper <code>hjkl</code> bindings. Usually in major modes like this you want to bind <code>j</code> and <code>k</code> to <code>evil-next-line</code> and <code>evil-previous-line</code>, respectively.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Since <code>J</code> wasn’t taken, I changed <code>ibuffer-jump-to-buffer</code> to <code>J</code> and rebound <code>j</code> to <code>evil-next-line</code>.</li>\n<li>The binding for <code>k</code> is less obvious: it’s tied to <code>ibuffer-do-kill-lines</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Looking at the help documentation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>ibuffer-do-kill-lines</code> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in <code>ibuf-ext.el</code>.</p>\n<p><code>(ibuffer-do-kill-lines)</code></p>\n<p>Hide all of the currently marked lines.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>IBuffer has a marking system that lets you select multiple buffers on which to perform actions. Personally, I don’t care very much for hiding marked lines, so I simply removed that binding. Now we have</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>    (kbd \"j\") 'evil-next-line\n    (kbd \"k\") 'evil-previous-line</code></pre>\n<p>bound, which covers the absolute basics. But what about <code>l</code>? I’m used to <a href=\"http://www.nathantypanski.com/blog/2013-08-12-ranger.html\">ranger</a>, a Vim-inspired file manager, where <code>l</code> takes you <q>into</q> the current item. In IBuffer, <code>l</code> is bound to <code>ibuffer-redisplay</code>, a useless function that redisplays the current buffers without loading new ones.<a href=\"http://www.nathantypanski.com/blog/2014-08-03-a-vim-like-emacs-config.html#fn8\" class=\"footnoteRef\" id=\"fnref8\"><sup>8</sup></a> Deleting that line lets us rebind it to</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>    (kbd \"l\") 'ibuffer-visit-buffer</code></pre>\n<p>and now we can navigate IBuffer much more naturally.</p>\n<p>Another Ranger replication: by default, <code>ibuffer-toggle-marks</code> is bound to <code>t</code>, and <code>v</code> is bound to <code>ibuffer-do-view</code>, which opens the buffer at point fullscreen and hides the others. I never need to do that, so I’ve added</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>    (kbd \"v\") 'ibuffer-toggle-marks</code></pre>\n<p>to my config.</p>\n<p>I’ll add that it’s not really necessary to duplicate the entire keymap in your init file. As you’d guess, you only need to explicitly define keys in Evil if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Evil would overwrite them otherwise, replacing them with something useless</li>\n<li>You need to change them</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If neither of these apply, then you can get rid of the bindings. But pasting them in to start with, then trimming the bindings down to what you’re actually interested in gives you the chance to examine the default keymap and rebind things that sound useful.</p>\n</section>\n<section id=\"handling-lots-of-buffers\" class=\"level3\">\n<h3>Handling lots of buffers</h3>\n<p>Over time, when you use Emacs you’ll end up with a lot of garbage buffers.

Emacs has a variable called <code>load-path</code> that you can use to customize where it looks for files. This is similar to the <code>$PATH</code> variable in most UNIX-derived shells.</p>\n<p>Adding the following to the beginning of your <code>~/.emacs.d/init.el</code> file will make Elisp files in the directory <code>~/.emacs.d/config</code> available for loading:</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>(add-to-list 'load-path (concat user-emacs-directory \"config\"))</code></pre>\n<p>If you use <code>K</code> in Evil’s normal state to look up the definition of <code>concat</code>, you’ll see:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>(concat &amp;rest SEQUENCES)</code></p>\n<p>Concatenate all the arguments and make the result a string. The result is a string whose elements are the elements of all the arguments.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Since this won’t be the last time you see it, I suggest reading the docs for <code>add-to-list</code> as well.</p>\n<p>You can use <code>M-x describe-variable</code> to see the definition of <code>user-emacs-directory</code> or <code>load-path</code>. It will also tell you the variable’s value. Hitting <code>K</code> with the symbol at point will also take you to this, but it’s good to do it the hard way at least once.</p>\n<p>Now you can create a file, <code>~/.emacs.d/config/my-ibuffer.el</code>, and move your IBuffer configuration over there. It won’t be loadable by default, though, unless you declare it at the bottom of the file:</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>;; code goes here\n\n(provide 'my-ibuffer)</code></pre>\n<p>Then, in <code>~/.emacs.d/init.el</code>, you’ll need to <code>require</code> the file, as we did with Evil and Slime, for it to be loaded automatically.</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>(require 'my-ibuffer)</code></pre>\n<p>Now your IBuffer settings will be loaded at startup, but they won’t clutter your main init file.</p>\n</section>\n<section id=\"dired\" class=\"level2\">\n<h2>Dired</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html\">Dired</a> is one of Emacs’ killer apps - a full-featured file manager built in to the editor. No package installation necessary. But the default bindings in Evil get some core things wrong, and not just in respect to my Vim-like preferences.</p>\n<p>Dired is very good about using single-key bindings for the most important things. Changing them to be better is easy: you just have to know what functions to bind.</p>\n<p>First, opening a subdirectory in Dired spawns a new Dired buffer. The sane action, <code>dired-find-alternate-file</code>, is locked behind a feature gate that will prompt you the first time you use it. I rebound <code>l</code> to <code>dired-find-alternate-file</code>, which means that moving <q>forward</q> into a new Dired buffer happens in the same buffer (or window) as the current one. This does wonders in not cluttering up my buffer list with dead Dired exploration.</p>\n<p>Repeating the steps used to build a new keymap for IBuffer, we can hack apart the Dired maps similarily so.</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>  (evil-define-key 'normal dired-mode-map \"h\" 'dired-up-directory)\n  (evil-define-key 'normal dired-mode-map \"l\" 'dired-find-alternate-file)\n  (evil-define-key 'normal dired-mode-map \"o\" 'dired-sort-toggle-or-edit)\n  (evil-define-key 'normal dired-mode-map \"v\" 'dired-toggle-marks)\n  (evil-define-key 'normal dired-mode-map \"m\" 'dired-mark)\n  (evil-define-key 'normal dired-mode-map \"u\" 'dired-unmark)\n  (evil-define-key 'normal dired-mode-map \"U\" 'dired-unmark-all-marks)\n  (evil-define-key 'normal dired-mode-map \"c\" 'dired-create-directory)\n  (evil-define-key 'normal dired-mode-map \"n\" 'evil-search-next)\n  (evil-define-key 'normal dired-mode-map \"N\" 'evil-search-previous)\n  (evil-define-key 'normal dired-mode-map \"q\" 'kill-this-buffer)</code></pre>\n<p>You’ll notice the mark toggling is rebound to <code>v</code> here as well, which gives me a somewhat consistent interface between <code>ranger</code>, Dired, and IBuffer.</p>\n<p>Rebinding <code>n</code> is another important thing here. By default, <code>n</code> and <code>p</code> are used for navigation within Dired, but with <code>hjkl</code> bindings set that’s not really useful. Changing <code>n</code> and <code>N</code> to Evil’s search commands gives us Vim-like searching within the file manager.</p>\n<p>Another thing to note about the above code is that I’ve made each binding an explicit expression. This is useful when you’re just testing new keybindings - if you might want to change them and play around until you find something that works, you want to be able to evaluate each expression independently. If we feel like evaluating these all at the same time, we can just surround them in a <code>(progn)</code> block, or visual select the code and use <code>M-x eval-region</code> to do so.</p>\n<p>One problem with this config is that while <code>l</code> will use <code>dired-find-alternate-file</code>, <code>h</code> will keep the old Dired buffers around. To fix this, we need to write a function that will jump up one directory, and close the old Dired buffer.</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>(defun my-dired-up-directory ()\n  \"Take dired up one directory, but behave like dired-find-alternate-file\"\n  (interactive)\n  (let ((old (current-buffer)))\n    (dired-up-directory)\n    (kill-buffer old)\n    ))</code></pre>\n<p>Rebinding <code>h</code> to our new function makes buffer navigation behave much closer to other Vim-like file browsers.</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>(evil-define-key 'normal dired-mode-map \"h\" 'my-dired-up-directory)</code></pre>\n<section id=\"dired-x\" class=\"level3\">\n<h3>Dired-x</h3>\n<p>Many incredibly useful Dired features are disabled by default, like <code>dired-jump</code>, which jumps to a Dired buffer in the same place as the current file.</p>\n<p>Adding the following to your init file will enable these <q>advanced</q> features, making Dired a much nicer environment to work in:</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>(require 'dired-x)</code></pre>\n<p>Some of my Dired-related keybindings, like <code>dired-jump</code> below, require <code>dired-x</code> loaded to work.</p>\n</section>\n</section>\n<section id=\"evil-leader\" class=\"level2\">\n<h2>Evil-Leader</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/cofi/evil-leader\">Evil-Leader</a> lets you define a leader key within Evil.

It’s fairly high-level, however, and doesn’t cover the nitty-gritty: all those long, painful hours spent trying to smash Emacs into reasonable keybindings are lost. You get the retrospective, the analysis, but not the same benefit of hindsight I’ve gathered since I switched. Unfortunately, there aren’t many resources out there on how to do this <em>right</em>. People use Emacs. It’s a tool. Most of its users don’t write about it, and the percentage of Emacs users who try to emulate Vim and also write about it is even smaller.</p>\n<p>There is <a href=\"http://bling.github.io/\">Bling</a>, the vim-airline developer, who switched and ultimately convinced me to give Emacs a shot. But his tips just scratch the surface of what’s necessary to replicate the finger-friendliness of a modern Vim workflow.</p>\n<p>It’s a well-known and overstated joke that the default Emacs bindings are bad. If you’re reading this post, you probably already agree with me here, but for the uninitiated: key combos are the devil. Any time you are pressing two keys at once, with the same hand, hundreds of times per day, you are setting yourself up for repetitive stress injury. As programmers, we need to take care of our hands or our careers will be over.</p>\n<p>This is going to be part-tutorial, part describing my configuration. With a little determination, this can take you from ground-zero to a working Evil configuration and generic development environment.</p>\n<p>This post is geared at the <strong>determined Vim user</strong> who is willing to give Evil a shot and likes having a heavily customized editor. It has a number of tasks that are intended to teach the right attitude and mindset required to keep working with Emacs on your own. These will get you familiar enough with reading documentation that you know where to look when you want to do something. It is also Elisp-focused, with no emphasis on the more <q>modern</q> customization features of Emacs that ultimately prevent new users from groking its internals.</p>\n<section id=\"first-some-terminology\" class=\"level2\">\n<h2>First, some terminology</h2>\n<p>When you first fire up Emacs, you need to learn how they reference certain objects and keybindings. This is pretty simple, but can be confusing if you don’t have the initial introduction.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>M-x</code> means <q>press the <code>&lt;ALT&gt;</code> key, then press <code>x</code> while still holding that down</q>. This brings up the Emacs command prompt, which gives you access to any of the functions that are declared <strong>interactive</strong> - that is, Elisp functions that may be run interactively by the user.</li>\n<li>If someone gives you a command sequence like <code>M-x package-install &lt;RET&gt; evil &lt;RET&gt;</code>, that means to do the <code>M-x</code> keybinding, type <code>package-install</code>, press enter, then type <code>evil</code> and press enter. Often the second <code>&lt;RET&gt;</code> will be omitted and taken as implicit.</li>\n<li>A <strong>buffer</strong> is a place where text may go. This is distinct from a <strong>window</strong> which is a visual area on screen which displays a buffer.</li>\n<li>A <strong>frame</strong> is another Emacs window in your window manager that is attached to the same Emacs process.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That’s it for the basics. Let’s see where we can go from here.</p>\n</section>\n<section id=\"package-archives\" class=\"level2\">\n<h2>Package archives</h2>\n<p>In order to install packages from things besides the default repos, you need to define a variable called <code>package-archives</code> with the URLs of the package sources in it. You do this in your <code>init.el</code> file, which is located at <code>~/.emacs.d/init.el</code> by default.</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>(setq package-archives '((\"melpa\" . \"http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/\")\n                         (\"org\" . \"http://orgmode.org/elpa/\")\n                         (\"gnu\" . \"http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/\")))</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"http://melpa.milkbox.net/\">MELPA</a> is the most important source for up-to-date Emacs packages. It’s kind of like the <a href=\"http://www.nathantypanski.com/blog/2014-07-25-all-your-daemons.html\">Arch Linux</a> of Emacs package archives - it builds directly from upstream all the time, and it works with the builtin Emacs package manager.</p>\n<p>Also, below the above code, you’ll need to initialize the package manager.</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>(require 'package)\n(package-initialize)</code></pre>\n<p>Once you’ve added the above to that file, you can evaluate each of these expressions inside Emacs with <code>C-x C-e</code>. To evaluate an expression, position the cursor outside and following the expression and hit that keybinding. This runs the command <code>eval-last-sexp</code>, which evaluates the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression\">symbolic expression</a> before your cursor and pretty-prints the output.</p>\n<p>You’ll need to do this in order (i.e., evaluate the <code>setq</code> expression first), or it won’t work.</p>\n<section id=\"installing-evil\" class=\"level3\">\n<h3>Installing Evil</h3>\n<p>Once the above is finished, you can install <code>evil-mode</code> with <code>M-x package-install &lt;RET&gt; evil &lt;RET&gt;</code>. The compilation log that pops up at the bottom of the screen can be killed with <code>C-x 4 0</code>. That runs the function <code>kill-buffer-and-window</code>, which you can also call interactively at the <code>M-x</code> prompt. More on that later.</p>\n<p>After that, Evil will be installed into the <code>~/.emacs.d</code> directory. To enable it, type <code>M-x evil-mode</code>. Now all your Vim bindings work, as long as you don’t kill Emacs.</p>\n<p>You probably want to enable Evil more permanently. Add the following to the bottom of your <code>~/.emacs.d/init.el</code> file:</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>(require 'evil)\n(evil-mode 1)</code></pre>\n<p>This will automatically enable <code>evil-mode</code> every time you start Emacs. It’s important that it goes at the bottom of the file. Evil relies on starting up after the rest of your packages, so that it can detect them and overlay its keybindings appropriately.</p>\n<p>If you break your configuration, restart Emacs with:</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>$ emacs --debug-init</code></pre>\n<p>to get debug information on your init files. Don’t feel bad if you have to use Vim to fix them in the meantime. Don’t get worried thinking Evil is not a <q>first-class citizen</q> in Emacs: this is an editor built to be ripped to pieces by the competent user.</p>\n<p>The interesting part of Emacs is its Lisp engine. It’s the scores of reusable functions for automating your interaction with code. Keybindings are just one way of calling these things.</p>\n</section>\n</section>\n<section id=\"modes\" class=\"level2\">\n<h2>Modes</h2>\n<p>Like Vim, Emacs uses the word <q>modes</q> to refer to an element of state in its editor. Unlike Vim, this is not referring to <em>modal editing</em>, but rather to the composition of various modules that make up your current editing environment.</p>\n<p>A <strong>major mode</strong> defines your primary interaction with a buffer in Emacs. There can only be one of these active at once, and they are not all necessarily for editing text. For example, <code>dired</code> is a major mode for editing directories, and <code>magit</code> is a Git interaction interface. An important major mode to be aware of is <code>fundamental mode</code>, which is a major mode with no discerning features besides the ability to type text into a buffer.</p>\n<p><strong>Minor modes</strong> are compositional - there can be more than one of them, and minor modes loaded after others can override the settings of a previous one. Evil is one such example of a minor mode.</p>\n<section id=\"states\" class=\"level4\">\n<h4>States</h4>\n<p>Evil uses the term <em>state</em> to refer to what Vim calls a <q>mode</q>. There are more states than these, but here are a few to get you going:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>evil-emacs-state</code><a href=\"http://www.nathantypanski.com/blog/2014-08-03-a-vim-like-emacs-config.html#fn1\" class=\"footnoteRef\" id=\"fnref1\"><sup>1</sup></a></li>\n<li><code>evil-insert-state</code></li>\n<li><code>evil-normal-state</code></li>\n<li><code>evil-visual-state</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each of these can be called interactively with <code>M-x</code> to enable them. The way Evil works is each of these states is bound to a different keymap, and those keymaps change the meanings of your keys to call different functions when they are pressed. This affords you the ability to remap bindings across different states, where they will only work when <code>evil-mode</code> is enabled and Evil is also in the right state to activate the keymap.</p>\n<p>Use <code>ESC</code>, <code>i</code>, <code>v</code>, etc. as you would in Vim to switch between Evil states. Then play around with using <code>M-x</code> to toggle the different states before moving on.</p>\n</section>\n</section>\n<section id=\"binding-keys\" class=\"level2\">\n<h2>Binding keys</h2>\n<p>Let’s get started by adding some bindings to Evil. We want switching between windows to be easy, so we can bind the following:</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>(define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd \"C-h\") 'evil-window-left)\n(define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd \"C-j\") 'evil-window-down)\n(define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd \"C-k\") 'evil-window-up)\n(define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd \"C-l\") 'evil-window-right)</code></pre>\n<p>This binds <code>&lt;CTRL&gt;-hjkl</code> to window movement commands when Evil is in normal state.</p>\n<p>There are a number of interesting things about these expressions. First, position your cursor over the word <code>define-key</code> and call <code>M-x describe-function</code>. It will provide the default value of the thing under your cursor, so you can just press <code>RET</code> again to bring up a buffer with help information. Read the help information it gives you, then move on. The buffer that appears will be in <code>help-mode</code>, which does not have Evil bindings, but you can use <code>q</code> to close it and keep working.</p>\n<p>The proper term in Emacs for <q>your cursor</q> would be <strong>point</strong>. This is used extensively in the help documentation, so it’s worth remembering. The <q>thing</q> at point that provided the default argument for <code>describe-function</code> was a <strong>symbol</strong>.<a href=\"http://www.nathantypanski.com/blog/2014-08-03-a-vim-like-emacs-config.html#fn2\" class=\"footnoteRef\" id=\"fnref2\"><sup>2</sup></a> A symbol is basically any thing in Emacs Lisp which has a <em>name</em> and can be hashed into a lookup table, where it then becomes an <strong>object</strong> in Lisp. These objects could be anything: functions, data, or text, for example, but symbols are interesting because we can give them names and refer to them later somehow.</p>\n<p>From the <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Symbols.html\">official manual</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You can test whether an arbitrary Lisp object is a symbol with <code>symbolp</code>:</p>\n<p>— Function: <strong>symbolp</strong> <em>object</em></p>\n<p>This function returns <code>t</code> if <em>object</em> is a symbol, <code>nil</code> otherwise.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now, use <code>M-x apropos RET point RET</code> and skim through the list that pops up. If you have Evil working properly, you can use <code>:q</code> to close that window when you’re done with it.</p>\n<section id=\"quoting\" class=\"level3\">\n<h3>Quoting</h3>\n<p>Readers with keen eyes may have noticed that one of the arguments in the above code has an apostrophe (<code>'</code>) before it. This is because <code>evil-window-left</code> is a function’s name, and we want to be able to call it later by binding it to a key. Putting an apostrophe before it when passing it as an argument to a function means we’re passing the <strong>quoted</strong> form of <code>evil-window-left</code> to <code>define-key</code>, not what it evaluates to.</p>\n<p>Since our intent is to pass the <em>symbol</em> <code>'evil-window-left</code> into <code>define-key</code>, and not the evaluated form of <code>evil-window-left</code> itself, this is the right thing to do.</p>\n<p>All arguments in Elisp expressions, without quoting, will be evaluated before they are passed into a function call. Quoting lets us avoid that and pass their symbols instead.</p>\n</section>\n<section id=\"maps-and-keys\" class=\"level3\">\n<h3>Maps and keys</h3>\n<p>The two other arguments to each of those keybindings were unquoted. The keymap, <code>evil-normal-state-map</code>, goes directly into the function, since the purpose of <code>define-key</code> is to modify that map. The expression <code>(kbd \"C-h\")</code> is actually another separate function call that happens before the outside expression is evaluated. If we use <code>M-x describe-function</code> to look at the help documentation for <code>kbd</code>, we see:</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>kbd is a compiled Lisp function in `subr.el'.\n\n(kbd KEYS)\n\nConvert KEYS to the internal Emacs key representation.\nKEYS should be a string constant in the format used for\nsaving keyboard macros (see `edmacro-mode').</code></pre>\n<p>We need to use the <code>kbd</code> function to describe our keybindings, since they contain an extra operator (the <code>&lt;CTRL&gt;</code> key). While single character bindings can be looked up in keymaps directly, a key sequence like <code>C-h</code> is not stored in the map in that form.</p>\n<p>You can look at the value of <code>(kbd \"C-h\")</code> by typing it on a line below those bindings, and then evaluating it with <code>C-x C-e</code> as before. In the <strong>minibuffer</strong>, the text area with a blank line at the bottom of the screen, <code>\"^H\"</code> is displayed. That tells you that the expression</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>(define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd \"C-h\") 'evil-window-left)</code></pre>\n<p>is internally binding <code>\"^H\"</code> to <code>evil-window-left</code>, but don’t doing that yourself—the way it’s shown in the minibuffer is still a <em>displayed form</em>, which is different from the hashed value it eventually becomes.</p>\n</section>\n</section>\n<section id=\"lisp-navigation\" class=\"level2\">\n<h2>Lisp navigation</h2>\n<p>Accessing help documentation using <code>M-x describe-function</code> is pretty awesome, but the interface for doing it is fairly clunky. We can make it better using <code>elisp-sime-nav-mode</code>, the <a href=\"http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/\">superior Lisp interaction mode</a> for Emacs. You can install it with <code>M-x package-install RET elisp-slime-nav</code>.</p>\n<p>Slime mode needs to be enabled for it to be used. To do this, we will define a function that we’ll tie to the hook for <code>emacs-lisp-mode</code>. A <strong>hook</strong> is a function that gets evaluated when something predefined happens in your editor. Most modes have hooks already configured, and all you will need to do is add functions to call with them using <code>add-hook</code> for them to become useful.</p>\n<p>First we <code>require</code> the package <code>elisp-slime-nav</code>, which ensures that it is loaded when Emacs starts:</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>(require 'elisp-slime-nav)</code></pre>\n<p>Then we define our function:<a href=\"http://www.nathantypanski.com/blog/2014-08-03-a-vim-like-emacs-config.html#fn3\" class=\"footnoteRef\" id=\"fnref3\"><sup>3</sup></a></p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>(defun my-lisp-hook ()\n  (elisp-slime-nav-mode)\n  (turn-on-eldoc-mode)\n  )</code></pre>\n<p>Add that into your init file after the <code>require</code> call. Note that the function definition is prefixed by <code>my-</code>. While not all Emacs packages do this, Elisp does not have namespaces like Python or Ruby does. To counteract this, convention is to define all of your functions prefixed by your package name, and for personal code using <code>my-</code> is not uncommon.</p>\n<p>Then, we add it to to the <code>emacs-lisp-mode-hook</code> using <code>add-hook</code>:</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>(add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'my-lisp-hook)</code></pre>\n<p>This makes <code>elisp-slime-nav-mode</code> and <code>turn-on-eldoc-mode</code><a href=\"http://www.nathantypanski.com/blog/2014-08-03-a-vim-like-emacs-config.html#fn4\" class=\"footnoteRef\" id=\"fnref4\"><sup>4</sup></a> get called every time <code>emacs-lisp-mode</code> is enabled. Now go ahead and evaluate these with <code>C-x C-e</code>. To make this easier, you can surround the block in a <code>(progn)</code>, which makes the whole thing get treated as one big expression for evaluation:</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>(progn\n  (require 'elisp-slime-nav)\n  (defun my-lisp-hook ()\n    (elisp-slime-nav-mode)\n    (turn-on-eldoc-mode)\n    )\n  (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'my-lisp-hook)\n)</code></pre>\n<p>While the <code>(progn)</code> here doesn’t serve any practical purpose, it might help you group blocks of code for evaluation while you’re hacking at them.</p>\n<p>Since <code>emacs-lisp-mode</code> is already running (you’re in a <code>.el</code> file), you can force your hook’s evaluation by typing <code>(my-lisp-hook)</code> into the buffer and evaluating it manually.</p>\n<p>You’ll notice that when you hover over functions now, <code>eldoc-mode</code> shows their signature in the minibuffer. If you want to see the help information like we’d been doing manually before, though, you still need to type <code>describe-function</code> into the <code>M-x</code> prompt. Now that we have Slime, we can simplify this with another keybinding:<a href=\"http://www.nathantypanski.com/blog/2014-08-03-a-vim-like-emacs-config.html#fn5\" class=\"footnoteRef\" id=\"fnref5\"><sup>5</sup></a></p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>(evil-define-key 'normal emacs-lisp-mode-map (kbd \"K\")\n  'elisp-slime-nav-describe-elisp-thing-at-point)</code></pre>\n<p>Evaluating the above will do contextual lookup on the thing at point whenever you press <code>K</code> in Evil’s normal state.</p>\n<p>The syntax here is different from when we defined the <a href=\"http://www.nathantypanski.com/blog/2014-08-03-a-vim-like-emacs-config.html#binding-keys\">window movement bindings</a> earlier. This is because we want to define <code>K</code> to call <code>elisp-slime-nav-describe-elisp-thing-at-point</code> only when we are in <code>emacs-lisp-mode-map</code> and Evil is in normal state. The <code>evil-define-key</code> function lets us do this, by providing arguments for both the Evil state and the keymap for the binding to be active in.</p>\n<p>Now you have the tools necessary to explore Emacs Lisp code without getting lost. Doing documentation lookups on everything you see that you don’t understand is a great way to start familiarizing yourself with Elisp code.</p>\n<p>Before we move on, lookup the descriptions for <code>progn</code>, <code>require</code>, <code>add-hook</code>, and <code>emacs-lisp-mode-hook</code> and read them. Don’t be afraid if you encounter words you don’t understand. Seeing the bigger picture in all the lingo takes time, but just doing this will help you start to understand it.</p>\n</section>\n<section id=\"managing-buffers\" class=\"level2\">\n<h2>Managing buffers</h2>\n<p>You can list the buffers that are currently open by typing <code>M-x list-buffers</code>. Using the bindings we defined earlier, you can switch to the window that is opened and hit <code>q</code> to close it when you’re done. To switch to one of these buffers, typing <code>M-x switch-to-buffer</code> will bring up a minibuffer prompt where you can type the name of a buffer to switch to it.</p>\n<p>For a better listing, you can use <code>M-x ibuffer</code>.</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"http://www.nathantypanski.com/images/2014-08-ibuffer.png\" alt=\"IBuffer with the default settings\"><figcaption>IBuffer with the default settings</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>The default bindings you should care about right now are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>n</code> and <code>p</code> to go to the next and previous buffers.</li>\n<li><code>d</code> (marking the buffer for deletion), then <code>x</code> on a buffer will make it go away.</li>\n<li><code>RET</code> while a buffer name is at point will take you to that buffer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>IBuffer has all sorts of useful features for browsing, filtering, and editing open buffers. But at least for a Vim user, its keybindings won’t at all be intuitive. Typing <code>j</code> accidentally will call <code>jump-to-buffer</code>, which is almost certainly not what you want. If you felt like typing the name of the buffer at a prompt, you probably wouldn’t have opened IBuffer to begin with!</p>\n<p>Aside from being unnatural for Vim users, the interface to IBuffer isn’t actually that bad. The keybindings are mostly single-key sequences, unlike more poorly-designed Emacs modes, and the functions allow for quick actions that will save you tons of work.</p>\n<section id=\"stealing-ibuffers-keymap\" class=\"level3\">\n<h3>Stealing IBuffer’s keymap</h3>\n<p>When I previously wrote about my experience switching to Evil, I mentioned there are a <a href=\"http://www.nathantypanski.com/blog/2014-07-02-switching-to-emacs.html#new-habits\">couple of different ways</a> to deal with major mode keymaps being inconsistent with Evil. I’ll be covering the full remapping approach here, since it has a few benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your major modes will be more tightly integrated with Evil.</li>\n<li>You’ll have the ability to redefine keys at will, easily and quickly.</li>\n<li>Remapping keys this way offers a chance at better understanding the functions in a major mode, which might just be missed otherwise. For core components of Emacs, like IBuffer and dired, building a more useful keymap can be a rewarding learning experience in itself.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With <code>ibuffer</code> open, type <code>M-x describe-mode</code> to pull up the help info below.</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"http://www.nathantypanski.com/images/2014-08-ibuffer-link.png\" alt=\"A link to ibuffer.el in help-mode\"><figcaption>A link to <code>ibuffer.el</code> in <code>help-mode</code></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Following that link<a href=\"http://www.nathantypanski.com/blog/2014-08-03-a-vim-like-emacs-config.html#fn6\" class=\"footnoteRef\" id=\"fnref6\"><sup>6</sup></a> will take you to the source code for IBuffer. Somewhere in there, you’ll find the keymap:</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"http://www.nathantypanski.com/images/2014-08-ibuffer-default-map.png\" alt=\"Default IBuffer keymap\"><figcaption>Default IBuffer keymap</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Any one of these major mode keymaps is bound to be really large, so I won’t reproduce it here. The idea is to redefine these into a map within Evil, so IBuffer will respect your Evil keymaps and still have its functionality. The <code>evil-define-key</code> function we used earlier has the option of taking an unlimited number of arguments. Now, copy lines like the following out of <code>ibuffer.el</code>:</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>(define-key map (kbd \"m\") 'ibuffer-mark-forward)\n(define-key map (kbd \"t\") 'ibuffer-toggle-marks)\n(define-key map (kbd \"u\") 'ibuffer-unmark-forward)\n(define-key map (kbd \"=\") 'ibuffer-diff-with-file)\n(define-key map (kbd \"j\") 'ibuffer-jump-to-buffer)\n(define-key map (kbd \"M-g\") 'ibuffer-jump-to-buffer)\n(define-key map (kbd \"M-s a C-s\") 'ibuffer-do-isearch)\n(define-key map (kbd \"M-s a M-C-s\") 'ibuffer-do-isearch-regexp)\n;; ...</code></pre>\n<p>and drop them into <code>~/.emacs.d/init.el</code>, after <code>(require 'evil)</code>, like follows:</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>(evil-define-key 'normal ibuffer-mode-map\n  (kbd \"m\") 'ibuffer-mark-forward\n  (kbd \"t\") 'ibuffer-toggle-marks\n  (kbd \"u\") 'ibuffer-unmark-forward\n  (kbd \"=\") 'ibuffer-diff-with-file\n  (kbd \"j\") 'ibuffer-jump-to-buffer\n  (kbd \"M-g\") 'ibuffer-jump-to-buffer\n  (kbd \"M-s a C-s\") 'ibuffer-do-isearch\n  (kbd \"M-s a M-C-s\") 'ibuffer-do-isearch-regexp\n  ;; ...\n  )</code></pre>\n<p>I used a Vim macro and visual block selection to do the rewrite into <code>evil-define-key</code> form for me, and it only took about a minute to perform.</p>\n<p>To ensure IBuffer will use Evil’s keybindings, add the line</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>(evil-set-initial-state 'ibuffer-mode 'normal)</code></pre>\n<p>to your init file. You can use this to set Evil’s initial state for any major mode - before you know what to bind in a mode, sometimes using Emacs state isn’t a bad idea.</p>\n<p>Now, if you try to actually use this configuration, it won’t work.<a href=\"http://www.nathantypanski.com/blog/2014-08-03-a-vim-like-emacs-config.html#fn7\" class=\"footnoteRef\" id=\"fnref7\"><sup>7</sup></a> The reason is we need to ensure the Evil bindings are not applied until <em>after</em> IBuffer is loaded, since it needs to do some special setup. The solution here is to surround the bindings in an <code>eval-after-load</code> block, like follows:</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>(eval-after-load 'ibuffer\n  '(progn\n     (evil-set-initial-state 'ibuffer-mode 'normal)\n     (evil-define-key 'normal ibuffer-mode-map\n       (kbd \"m\") 'ibuffer-mark-forward\n       (kbd \"t\") 'ibuffer-toggle-marks\n       (kbd \"u\") 'ibuffer-unmark-forward\n       (kbd \"=\") 'ibuffer-diff-with-file\n       (kbd \"j\") 'ibuffer-jump-to-buffer\n       (kbd \"M-g\") 'ibuffer-jump-to-buffer\n       (kbd \"M-s a C-s\") 'ibuffer-do-isearch\n       (kbd \"M-s a M-C-s\") 'ibuffer-do-isearch-regexp\n       ;; ...\n       )\n     )\n   )</code></pre>\n<p>This ensures your custom keymap does not try to set itself until after ibuffer has already initialized it properly.</p>\n<p>Your goal after this section is to read the help information for <code>eval-after-load</code>, as well as for some of the IBuffer bindings. Just pick ones that seem interesting, and again - don’t worry if you don’t understand things. Just read a few of them anyway.</p>\n<p>Once you’ve done your reading, get the custom keymap to work by evaluating the block with <code>C-x C-e</code>, and ensure it’s functional in <code>evil-normal-state</code> by calling <code>M-x evil-normal-state</code> manually within IBuffer.</p>\n</section>\n<section id=\"rebinding\" class=\"level3\">\n<h3>Rebinding</h3>\n<p>You might think it’s crazy to place all of this configuration in one lone init file. We’ll get to that in the next section. For now, keeping things in <code>init.el</code> will get the job done and let us focus on keybindings.</p>\n<p>The obvious thing to do, now that we’ve copied the keymap, is to add proper <code>hjkl</code> bindings. Usually in major modes like this you want to bind <code>j</code> and <code>k</code> to <code>evil-next-line</code> and <code>evil-previous-line</code>, respectively.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Since <code>J</code> wasn’t taken, I changed <code>ibuffer-jump-to-buffer</code> to <code>J</code> and rebound <code>j</code> to <code>evil-next-line</code>.</li>\n<li>The binding for <code>k</code> is less obvious: it’s tied to <code>ibuffer-do-kill-lines</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Looking at the help documentation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>ibuffer-do-kill-lines</code> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in <code>ibuf-ext.el</code>.</p>\n<p><code>(ibuffer-do-kill-lines)</code></p>\n<p>Hide all of the currently marked lines.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>IBuffer has a marking system that lets you select multiple buffers on which to perform actions. Personally, I don’t care very much for hiding marked lines, so I simply removed that binding. Now we have</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>    (kbd \"j\") 'evil-next-line\n    (kbd \"k\") 'evil-previous-line</code></pre>\n<p>bound, which covers the absolute basics. But what about <code>l</code>? I’m used to <a href=\"http://www.nathantypanski.com/blog/2013-08-12-ranger.html\">ranger</a>, a Vim-inspired file manager, where <code>l</code> takes you <q>into</q> the current item. In IBuffer, <code>l</code> is bound to <code>ibuffer-redisplay</code>, a useless function that redisplays the current buffers without loading new ones.<a href=\"http://www.nathantypanski.com/blog/2014-08-03-a-vim-like-emacs-config.html#fn8\" class=\"footnoteRef\" id=\"fnref8\"><sup>8</sup></a> Deleting that line lets us rebind it to</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>    (kbd \"l\") 'ibuffer-visit-buffer</code></pre>\n<p>and now we can navigate IBuffer much more naturally.</p>\n<p>Another Ranger replication: by default, <code>ibuffer-toggle-marks</code> is bound to <code>t</code>, and <code>v</code> is bound to <code>ibuffer-do-view</code>, which opens the buffer at point fullscreen and hides the others. I never need to do that, so I’ve added</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>    (kbd \"v\") 'ibuffer-toggle-marks</code></pre>\n<p>to my config.</p>\n<p>I’ll add that it’s not really necessary to duplicate the entire keymap in your init file. As you’d guess, you only need to explicitly define keys in Evil if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Evil would overwrite them otherwise, replacing them with something useless</li>\n<li>You need to change them</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If neither of these apply, then you can get rid of the bindings. But pasting them in to start with, then trimming the bindings down to what you’re actually interested in gives you the chance to examine the default keymap and rebind things that sound useful.</p>\n</section>\n<section id=\"handling-lots-of-buffers\" class=\"level3\">\n<h3>Handling lots of buffers</h3>\n<p>Over time, when you use Emacs you’ll end up with a lot of garbage buffers. Tons of different commands will open scratch buffers to show you things and never kill them.

Emacs has a variable called <code>load-path</code> that you can use to customize where it looks for files. This is similar to the <code>$PATH</code> variable in most UNIX-derived shells.</p>\n<p>Adding the following to the beginning of your <code>~/.emacs.d/init.el</code> file will make Elisp files in the directory <code>~/.emacs.d/config</code> available for loading:</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>(add-to-list 'load-path (concat user-emacs-directory \"config\"))</code></pre>\n<p>If you use <code>K</code> in Evil’s normal state to look up the definition of <code>concat</code>, you’ll see:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>(concat &amp;rest SEQUENCES)</code></p>\n<p>Concatenate all the arguments and make the result a string. The result is a string whose elements are the elements of all the arguments.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Since this won’t be the last time you see it, I suggest reading the docs for <code>add-to-list</code> as well.</p>\n<p>You can use <code>M-x describe-variable</code> to see the definition of <code>user-emacs-directory</code> or <code>load-path</code>. It will also tell you the variable’s value. Hitting <code>K</code> with the symbol at point will also take you to this, but it’s good to do it the hard way at least once.</p>\n<p>Now you can create a file, <code>~/.emacs.d/config/my-ibuffer.el</code>, and move your IBuffer configuration over there. It won’t be loadable by default, though, unless you declare it at the bottom of the file:</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>;; code goes here\n\n(provide 'my-ibuffer)</code></pre>\n<p>Then, in <code>~/.emacs.d/init.el</code>, you’ll need to <code>require</code> the file, as we did with Evil and Slime, for it to be loaded automatically.</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>(require 'my-ibuffer)</code></pre>\n<p>Now your IBuffer settings will be loaded at startup, but they won’t clutter your main init file.</p>\n</section>\n<section id=\"dired\" class=\"level2\">\n<h2>Dired</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html\">Dired</a> is one of Emacs’ killer apps - a full-featured file manager built in to the editor. No package installation necessary. But the default bindings in Evil get some core things wrong, and not just in respect to my Vim-like preferences.</p>\n<p>Dired is very good about using single-key bindings for the most important things. Changing them to be better is easy: you just have to know what functions to bind.</p>\n<p>First, opening a subdirectory in Dired spawns a new Dired buffer. The sane action, <code>dired-find-alternate-file</code>, is locked behind a feature gate that will prompt you the first time you use it. I rebound <code>l</code> to <code>dired-find-alternate-file</code>, which means that moving <q>forward</q> into a new Dired buffer happens in the same buffer (or window) as the current one. This does wonders in not cluttering up my buffer list with dead Dired exploration.</p>\n<p>Repeating the steps used to build a new keymap for IBuffer, we can hack apart the Dired maps similarily so.</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>  (evil-define-key 'normal dired-mode-map \"h\" 'dired-up-directory)\n  (evil-define-key 'normal dired-mode-map \"l\" 'dired-find-alternate-file)\n  (evil-define-key 'normal dired-mode-map \"o\" 'dired-sort-toggle-or-edit)\n  (evil-define-key 'normal dired-mode-map \"v\" 'dired-toggle-marks)\n  (evil-define-key 'normal dired-mode-map \"m\" 'dired-mark)\n  (evil-define-key 'normal dired-mode-map \"u\" 'dired-unmark)\n  (evil-define-key 'normal dired-mode-map \"U\" 'dired-unmark-all-marks)\n  (evil-define-key 'normal dired-mode-map \"c\" 'dired-create-directory)\n  (evil-define-key 'normal dired-mode-map \"n\" 'evil-search-next)\n  (evil-define-key 'normal dired-mode-map \"N\" 'evil-search-previous)\n  (evil-define-key 'normal dired-mode-map \"q\" 'kill-this-buffer)</code></pre>\n<p>You’ll notice the mark toggling is rebound to <code>v</code> here as well, which gives me a somewhat consistent interface between <code>ranger</code>, Dired, and IBuffer.</p>\n<p>Rebinding <code>n</code> is another important thing here. By default, <code>n</code> and <code>p</code> are used for navigation within Dired, but with <code>hjkl</code> bindings set that’s not really useful. Changing <code>n</code> and <code>N</code> to Evil’s search commands gives us Vim-like searching within the file manager.</p>\n<p>Another thing to note about the above code is that I’ve made each binding an explicit expression. This is useful when you’re just testing new keybindings - if you might want to change them and play around until you find something that works, you want to be able to evaluate each expression independently. If we feel like evaluating these all at the same time, we can just surround them in a <code>(progn)</code> block, or visual select the code and use <code>M-x eval-region</code> to do so.</p>\n<p>One problem with this config is that while <code>l</code> will use <code>dired-find-alternate-file</code>, <code>h</code> will keep the old Dired buffers around. To fix this, we need to write a function that will jump up one directory, and close the old Dired buffer.</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>(defun my-dired-up-directory ()\n  \"Take dired up one directory, but behave like dired-find-alternate-file\"\n  (interactive)\n  (let ((old (current-buffer)))\n    (dired-up-directory)\n    (kill-buffer old)\n    ))</code></pre>\n<p>Rebinding <code>h</code> to our new function makes buffer navigation behave much closer to other Vim-like file browsers.</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>(evil-define-key 'normal dired-mode-map \"h\" 'my-dired-up-directory)</code></pre>\n<section id=\"dired-x\" class=\"level3\">\n<h3>Dired-x</h3>\n<p>Many incredibly useful Dired features are disabled by default, like <code>dired-jump</code>, which jumps to a Dired buffer in the same place as the current file.</p>\n<p>Adding the following to your init file will enable these <q>advanced</q> features, making Dired a much nicer environment to work in:</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>(require 'dired-x)</code></pre>\n<p>Some of my Dired-related keybindings, like <code>dired-jump</code> below, require <code>dired-x</code> loaded to work.</p>\n</section>\n</section>\n<section id=\"evil-leader\" class=\"level2\">\n<h2>Evil-Leader</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/cofi/evil-leader\">Evil-Leader</a> lets you define a leader key within Evil.

As usual, <code>M-x package-install RET evil-leader</code> will install this for you.</p>\n<p>You should <code>require</code> Evil-Leader and run <code>(global-evil-leader-mode)</code> <em>before</em> Evil is loaded, or otherwise it won’t work in buffers like <code>*scratch*</code> and <code>*messages*</code>.</p>\n<p>The first obvious thing to do is to bind <code>w</code> and <code>q</code> to save and quit functions, as many people do in Vim:</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>(evil-leader/set-leader \",\")\n(evil-leader/set-key \"w\" 'save-buffer)\n(evil-leader/set-key \"q\" 'kill-buffer-and-window)</code></pre>\n<p>Some other useful Evil-Leader bindings that work with all the packages we’ve seen so far:</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>(evil-leader/set-key \"h\" 'dired-jump)\n(evil-leader/set-key \"v\" 'split-window-right)\n(evil-leader/set-key \"e\" 'pp-eval-last-sexp)\n(evil-leader/set-key \",\" 'other-window)\n(evil-leader/set-key \"b\" 'ibuffer)\n(evil-leader/set-key \"x\" 'helm-M-x)</code></pre>\n<p>With these set, we can eliminate two-key combos in most of our daily editing tasks.</p>\n</section>\n<section id=\"use-package\" class=\"level2\">\n<h2>Use-package</h2>\n<p>As you start collecting Emacs plugins, your startup times will begin to grow. In addition, your ability to deploy on multiple machines (which may not have those plugins installed) and handle dependencies properly will decrease significantly over time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package\">Use-package</a> lets you avoid that problem by automating the bad parts of configuring a package, and establishing deferred bindings so that you can evaluate code after a given package is loaded, and trigger a package loading on the evaluation of arbitrary commands or opening of arbitrary filetypes.</p>\n<p>With it, the top section of my init file looks like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>(require 'package)\n(package-initialize)\n(setq package-enable-at-startup nil)\n\n(add-to-list 'load-path (concat user-emacs-directory \"config\"))\n(setq package-archives '((\"melpa\" . \"http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/\")\n                         (\"org\" . \"http://orgmode.org/elpa/\")\n                         (\"gnu\" . \"http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/\")))\n\n(unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)\n    (package-refresh-contents)\n    (package-install 'use-package))\n(require 'use-package)</code></pre>\n<p>The effect of this is that it automatically downloads and installs <code>use-package</code> from MELPA if it isn’t already present.

This means your daemonizing system will eventually fail, and your system will be broken.<a href=\"http://www.nathantypanski.com/blog/2014-07-25-all-your-daemons.html#fnref1\">↩</a></p></li>\n<li id=\"fn2\"><p>Example output:</p>\n<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><code>$ userctl status gitit\n● gitit.service - my personal wiki\n   Loaded: loaded (/home/nathan/.config/systemd/user/gitit.service; enabled)\n   Active: active (running) since Fri 2014-07-25 21:21:16 EDT; 13min ago\n Main PID: 4905 (gitit)\n   CGroup: /user.slice/user-1000.slice/user@1000.service/gitit.service\n           └─4905 /home/nathan/.cabal/bin/gitit -f /home/nathan/.gitit/my.conf\n\nJul 25 21:21:16 dionysus systemd[388]: Started my personal wiki.</code></pre>\n<a href=\"http://www.nathantypanski.com/blog/2014-07-25-all-your-daemons.html#fnref2\">↩</a></li>\n<li id=\"fn3\"><p>I made <a href=\"https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Special:Contributions/Ndt\">16 contributions</a> even during the 6 months I used Debian primarily.

All illustrations are by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OlgaShalakhina\">Olga Shalakhina</a>, based on the Go gopher designed by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/reneefrench\">Renée French</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"introducing-the-go-playground:c814c2f3adf5f13a57ca7a2fe6be8cfd\">Introducing the Go Playground</h2>\n\n<p>The quickest way to get started with Go is to navigate to <a href=\"https://play.golang.org\">play.golang.org</a>. The Go Playground enables you to edit, run, and experiment with Go without needing to install anything. When you click the <strong>[Run]</strong> button, the Playground will compile and execute your code on Google servers and display the result.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"The Go Playground\" class=\"full\" src=\"https://nathany.com/images/playground.png\"></p>\n\n<p>The Go Playground does have some limitations. For example, the only way you can save your work is by clicking the <strong>[Share]</strong> button and keeping a list of bookmarks. Most gophers prefer to use a text editor and the command line running on their own computer, but you can become comfortable with Go with just your web browser.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"packages-and-functions:c814c2f3adf5f13a57ca7a2fe6be8cfd\">Packages and functions</h2>\n\n<p>When you visit the Go Playground, you will see the following code, which is as good a starting point as any.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-go\" data-lang=\"go\"><span class=\"kn\">package</span> <span class=\"nx\">main</span> <span class=\"c1\">// #1</span>\n\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"s\">\"fmt\"</span> <span class=\"c1\">// #2</span>\n\n<span class=\"kd\">func</span> <span class=\"nx\">main</span><span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span> <span class=\"c1\">// #3</span>\n    <span class=\"nx\">fmt</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">Println</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">\"Hello, playground\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"c1\">// #4</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Listing 1. Hello, playground: <a href=\"https://play.golang.org\">playground.go</a></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Declare the package the following code belongs to</li>\n<li>Make the <code>fmt</code> (format) package available for use</li>\n<li>Declare a function named main</li>\n<li>Print <em>Hello, playground</em> to the screen</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Though short, the previous listing introduces three keywords: <code>package</code>, <code>import</code>, and <code>func</code>. Each keyword is reserved for a special purpose.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>package</code> keyword declares the package this code belongs to, in this case a package named <code>main</code>. All code in Go is organized into <em>packages</em>. Go provides a standard library comprised of packages for math, compression, cryptography, manipulating images, and more. Each package corresponds to a single idea. The next line uses the <code>import</code> keyword to specify which packages this code will use.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Hello World gopher\" class=\"left\" src=\"https://nathany.com/images/learn-go-hello-world.svg\"></p>\n\n<p>Packages contain any number of useful functions, for example, the <code>math</code> package provides functions like <code>Sin</code>, <code>Cos</code>, <code>Tan</code>, and <code>Sqrt</code> (square root). The <code>fmt</code> package provides functions for <em>formatted</em> input and output. Displaying text to the screen is a frequent operation, so this package name is abbreviated as <code>fmt</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>func</code> keyword declares a function, in this case a function named <code>main</code>. The body of each function is enclosed in curly braces <code>{}</code>, so Go knows where each function begins and ends.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"A game board\" class=\"right\" src=\"https://nathany.com/images/learn-go-start-somewhere.svg\">\nEvery program needs to start somewhere. When you run a program written in Go, it starts at the <code>main</code> function in the <code>main</code> package. Without <code>main</code>, the Go compiler will report an error, because it doesn’t know where the program will start.</p>\n\n<p>To print a <em>line</em> of text, you can use the <code>Println</code> function. <code>Println</code> is prefixed with <code>fmt</code> followed by a dot because it is provided by the <code>fmt</code> package. Every time you use a function from an imported package, the function is prefixed with the package name and a dot. When you read code written in Go, it is immediately clear which package each function came from.</p>\n\n<p>When you run the program in the Go Playground, you see the text <em>Hello, playground</em>. The text to be displayed is enclosed in <code>\"quotes\"</code>. You know punctuation is important in English; a missing comma could change the meaning of a sentence. Go relies heavily on punctuation, like braces and quotes, to understand what you write.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"experiment:c814c2f3adf5f13a57ca7a2fe6be8cfd\">Experiment</h4>\n\n<p>Make the following changes to the code in the Go Playground:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Change the text printed to the screen by modifying what appears between quotes.</li>\n<li>Try printing text in Chinese, Japanese, Russian, or Spanish. Go supports characters of every language.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you get stuck, you can refresh your browser to get back to the first example.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"performing-calculations:c814c2f3adf5f13a57ca7a2fe6be8cfd\">Performing calculations</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Overweight gopher\" class=\"right\" height=\"240\" src=\"https://nathany.com/images/learn-go-plump.svg\"></p>\n\n<p>There are days when I think it would be nice to be younger and weigh a little less. In this regard, Mars has a lot to offer. It takes 687 earth days for Mars to travel around the sun, and a lower gravitational force means everything weighs approximately 38% of what it does on Earth.</p>\n\n<p>The following program helped me calculate how young and light I would be if I lived on Mars. Type and run it in the Go Playground.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-go\" data-lang=\"go\"><span class=\"c1\">// My weight loss program. // #1</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">package</span> <span class=\"nx\">main</span>\n\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"s\">\"fmt\"</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\">// main is the function where it all begins. // #1</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">func</span> <span class=\"nx\">main</span><span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"nx\">fmt</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">Print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">\"My weight on the surface of Mars is \"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"nx\">fmt</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">Print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mf\">210.0</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span> <span class=\"mf\">0.3783</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"c1\">// #2</span>\n    <span class=\"nx\">fmt</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">Print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">\" lbs, and I would be \"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"nx\">fmt</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">Print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">38</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span> <span class=\"mi\">365</span> <span class=\"o\">/</span> <span class=\"mi\">687</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"c1\">// #3</span>\n    <span class=\"nx\">fmt</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">Print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">\" years old.\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Listing 2. Hello Mars: <a href=\"https://play.golang.org/p/NVt8w6GhPx\">mars.go</a></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>A comment for human readers</li>\n<li>Print <em>79.443</em></li>\n<li>Print <em>20</em></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This code begins with a comment. When Go sees a double slash, it ignores everything until the end of the line. Computer programming is all about communication. Code communicates your instructions to a computer, and when written well, it communicates your intentions to other people. Comments are just for us.</p>\n\n<p>The previous listing calls the <code>Print</code> function several times to display a sentence on a single line. As you saw in <a href=\"https://nathany.com/learn-go/#playground.go\">Listing 1</a>, text is placed between double quotes. This program also displays the result of mathematical expressions.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"experiment-1:c814c2f3adf5f13a57ca7a2fe6be8cfd\">Experiment</h4>\n\n<p>Before you make travel plans, use Go to find out a little more about life on Mars:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>How much would you weigh on Mars? How old would you be? Replace my age (38) and weight (210.0) with your own. Try family members, pets, and friends.</p>\n\n<p><i class=\"fa fa-sticky-note-o fa-2x fa-pull-left fa-border\" title=\"Note\"></i> <a href=\"https://nathany.com/learn-go/#mars.go\">Listing 2</a> displays weight in pounds, but the unit doesn’t impact the weight calculation. Whichever unit you use, the weight on Mars is 37.83% of the provided weight. On the other hand, mass is 100% the same.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Did you notice that your age on Mars is displayed as a whole number while your weight has a decimal? What happens if you specify that an Earth year has precisely 365.2425 days?</p></li>\n\n<li><p>What happens if you use the <code>Println</code> function instead of <code>Print</code>?</p></li>\n\n<li><p>To display text, numbers, and mathematical expressions, you can pass the <code>Print</code> function a list of arguments separated by commas:</p>\n\n<p><code>fmt.Print(\"I am \", 38*365/687, \" years old on Mars.\")</code></p>\n\n<p>Modify <a href=\"https://nathany.com/learn-go/#mars.go\">Listing 2</a> to display the same output with only a single <code>Print</code> function.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><i class=\"fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-2x fa-pull-left fa-border\" title=\"Tip\"></i> After modifying your code, click the <strong>[Format]</strong> button in the Go Playground. It will automatically reformat the indentation and spacing of your code without changing what it does.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"constants-and-variables:c814c2f3adf5f13a57ca7a2fe6be8cfd\">Constants and variables</h2>\n\n<p>Now that I see the benefit of going to Mars, my next question is how long the trip will take. Traveling at the speed of light would really be ideal. Light travels at a <em>constant</em> speed in the vacuum of space, which makes the math easy. On the other hand, the distance between Earth and Mars <em>varies</em> significantly, depending on where each planet is in its orbit around the sun.</p>\n\n<p>The following listing introduces two new keywords, <code>const</code> and <code>var</code> for declaring constants and variables respectively.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-go\" data-lang=\"go\"><span class=\"c1\">// How long does it take to get to Mars?</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">package</span> <span class=\"nx\">main</span>\n\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"s\">\"fmt\"</span>\n\n<span class=\"kd\">func</span> <span class=\"nx\">main</span><span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"kd\">const</span> <span class=\"nx\">lightSpeed</span> <span class=\"p\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">299792</span> <span class=\"c1\">// km/s</span>\n    <span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">distance</span> <span class=\"p\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">56000000</span>   <span class=\"c1\">// km</span>\n\n    <span class=\"nx\">fmt</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">Println</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">distance</span><span class=\"o\">/</span><span class=\"nx\">lightSpeed</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">\"seconds\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"c1\">// #1</span>\n\n    <span class=\"nx\">distance</span> <span class=\"p\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">401000000</span>\n    <span class=\"nx\">fmt</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">Println</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">distance</span><span class=\"o\">/</span><span class=\"nx\">lightSpeed</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">\"seconds\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"c1\">// #2</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Listing 3. Traveling at the speed of light: <a href=\"https://play.golang.org/p/WwaBM472vC\">travel.go</a></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Print <em>186 seconds</em></li>\n<li>Print <em>1337 seconds</em></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The first calculation is based on Mars and Earth being nearby, with <code>distance</code> declared and assigned an initial value of 56,000,000 km. Then the <code>distance</code> variable is assigned a new value of 401,000,000 km, with the planets on opposite sides of the sun.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>lightSpeed</code> constant cannot be changed. If you try to assign it a new value, the Go compiler will report the error “cannot assign to lightSpeed”.</p>\n\n<p><i class=\"fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-2x fa-pull-left fa-border\" title=\"Tip\"></i> Variables must be declared before they are used. Go will report an error if you assign to a variable that hasn’t been declared with <code>var</code>, for example <code>speed = 16</code>. This can help catch mistakes, like accidentally assigning a value to <code>distence</code> when you intend to use <code>distance</code>.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"experiment-2:c814c2f3adf5f13a57ca7a2fe6be8cfd\">Experiment</h4>\n\n<p>Type <a href=\"https://nathany.com/learn-go/#travel.go\">Listing 3</a> into the Go Playground and click <strong>[Run]</strong>. Light speed is pretty convenient; I don’t hear anyone asking “are we there yet?”</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately these calculations aren’t the most realistic. Plotting a course directly through the sun could be problematic, and while traveling at light speed would be nice, the fastest spaceships today only manage 16 km/s. You can bring this program down to Earth with these changes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Declare a new <code>speed</code> variable and use it in place of <code>lightSpeed</code> to calculate the trip duration at 16 km/s.</li>\n\n<li><p>Print the trip’s duration as a number of days instead of seconds.</p>\n\n<p><i class=\"fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-2x fa-pull-left\" title=\"Tip\"></i> There are 86400 seconds in one Earth day.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Mars and Earth will be 57,600,000 km apart in July 2018. Calculate the trip duration for this launch window.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"faking-it-with-random-numbers:c814c2f3adf5f13a57ca7a2fe6be8cfd\">Faking it with random numbers</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"A traveling gopher\" class=\"right\" src=\"https://nathany.com/images/learn-go-travel.svg\">\nFinding an affordable ticket to Mars could be a challenge.

The Go Playground enables you to edit, run, and experiment with Go without needing to install anything. When you click the <strong>[Run]</strong> button, the Playground will compile and execute your code on Google servers and display the result.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"The Go Playground\" class=\"full\" src=\"https://nathany.com/images/playground.png\"></p>\n\n<p>The Go Playground does have some limitations. For example, the only way you can save your work is by clicking the <strong>[Share]</strong> button and keeping a list of bookmarks. Most gophers prefer to use a text editor and the command line running on their own computer, but you can become comfortable with Go with just your web browser.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"packages-and-functions:c814c2f3adf5f13a57ca7a2fe6be8cfd\">Packages and functions</h2>\n\n<p>When you visit the Go Playground, you will see the following code, which is as good a starting point as any.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-go\" data-lang=\"go\"><span class=\"kn\">package</span> <span class=\"nx\">main</span> <span class=\"c1\">// #1</span>\n\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"s\">\"fmt\"</span> <span class=\"c1\">// #2</span>\n\n<span class=\"kd\">func</span> <span class=\"nx\">main</span><span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span> <span class=\"c1\">// #3</span>\n    <span class=\"nx\">fmt</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">Println</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">\"Hello, playground\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"c1\">// #4</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Listing 1. Hello, playground: <a href=\"https://play.golang.org\">playground.go</a></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Declare the package the following code belongs to</li>\n<li>Make the <code>fmt</code> (format) package available for use</li>\n<li>Declare a function named main</li>\n<li>Print <em>Hello, playground</em> to the screen</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Though short, the previous listing introduces three keywords: <code>package</code>, <code>import</code>, and <code>func</code>. Each keyword is reserved for a special purpose.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>package</code> keyword declares the package this code belongs to, in this case a package named <code>main</code>. All code in Go is organized into <em>packages</em>. Go provides a standard library comprised of packages for math, compression, cryptography, manipulating images, and more. Each package corresponds to a single idea. The next line uses the <code>import</code> keyword to specify which packages this code will use.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Hello World gopher\" class=\"left\" src=\"https://nathany.com/images/learn-go-hello-world.svg\"></p>\n\n<p>Packages contain any number of useful functions, for example, the <code>math</code> package provides functions like <code>Sin</code>, <code>Cos</code>, <code>Tan</code>, and <code>Sqrt</code> (square root). The <code>fmt</code> package provides functions for <em>formatted</em> input and output. Displaying text to the screen is a frequent operation, so this package name is abbreviated as <code>fmt</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>func</code> keyword declares a function, in this case a function named <code>main</code>. The body of each function is enclosed in curly braces <code>{}</code>, so Go knows where each function begins and ends.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"A game board\" class=\"right\" src=\"https://nathany.com/images/learn-go-start-somewhere.svg\">\nEvery program needs to start somewhere. When you run a program written in Go, it starts at the <code>main</code> function in the <code>main</code> package. Without <code>main</code>, the Go compiler will report an error, because it doesn’t know where the program will start.</p>\n\n<p>To print a <em>line</em> of text, you can use the <code>Println</code> function. <code>Println</code> is prefixed with <code>fmt</code> followed by a dot because it is provided by the <code>fmt</code> package.

Building on top of DVCS is a brilliant move. There is a lovely <em>immediacy</em> to pulling in a dependency. <mark>Import and go.</mark></p>\n\n<p>Package managers like <a href=\"http://bundler.io/\">Bundler</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pip-installer.org/\">Pip</a> and <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.org/\">NPM</a> all have some mechanism to bypass their central repositories and pull code directly from source control. The go tool makes this first-class.</p>\n\n<p>When I want to contribute to an upstream package, those other tools force me to reconfigure my project. With the go tool, I switch to the package’s directory, make a change and test it out. Sending a pull request is just a few steps away. <mark>Open source collaboration made simple.</mark></p>\n\n<p>For hobbyists and those starting out, the go tool is all you need.</p>\n\n<p>Resources:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://golang.org/doc/code.html\">How to Write Go Code</a> (golang.org)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.goinggo.net/2013/08/organizing-code-to-support-go-get.html\">Organizing Code to Support Go Get</a> by William Kennedy</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The simplicity of the go tool does come with its trade-offs.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I want to have reproducible builds on different computers at different times.  This is currently problematic; let’s make things better.” - David Hinkes, <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/115983116618286597159/posts/gczN5SQ94ek\">Go+</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><code>Go get</code> does not have an explicit concept of versions. Members of a team may be importing different revisions <em>(version skew)</em>. Dependencies may introduce incompatibilities or security vulnerabilities, or even change licenses or disappear. For these reasons, it’s desirable to have more control over the upgrade process when building a real-world application.</p>\n\n<figure data-tooltip=\"Photograph © 2015 Nathan Youngman\" data-tooltip2=\"Go gopher designed by Renée French\">\n    <img alt=\"A plate of packages.\" class=\"full\" src=\"https://nathany.com/images/gopher-vendor.jpg\">\n    <figcaption>I had some packages for lunch and now they are part of me.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<h2 id=\"vendor-your-dependencies:abd56199fec422fd375b8f010dd9a93f\">Vendor Your Dependencies</h2>\n\n<p>Large companies like Google and Facebook do most development in a single giant repository. This enables massive refactors in a single commit, such as changing an API and every use of it.</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to third-party dependencies, the Go Team <a href=\"http://golang.org/doc/faq#get_version\">recommends</a> copying them into the source tree:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“If you’re using an externally supplied package and worry that it might change in unexpected ways, the simplest solution is to copy it to your local repository. (This is the approach Google takes internally.) Store the copy under a new import path that identifies it as a local copy. For example, you might copy <code>original.com/pkg</code> to <code>you.com/external/original.com/pkg</code>.” - <a href=\"http://golang.org/doc/faq#get_version\">Go FAQ</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is no need for a central archive of every version of every Go library ever released. Dependencies may move or disappear in the world outside your project, but your project has a copy of the dependencies it needs at any given point in history. Brad Fitzpatrick <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9VUCp98ay4&amp;t=36m55s\">describes this</a> as a <mark>“hermetic view of the world”</mark>.</p>\n\n<p>How is travelling back through the history of your project useful? Martin Fowler describes some benefits in <a href=\"http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ReproducibleBuild.html\">ReproducibleBuild</a>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>To reproduce a bug on the release branch that doesn’t happen on master.</li>\n<li>Using <code>bisect</code> to isolate the commit that introduced a bug.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It’s possible to upgrade dependencies in a controlled and tested manner, resolving all the stated issues with <code>go get</code>.</p>\n\n<p>So what are the trade-offs?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Compared to <code>go get</code>, it is a little more complicated, likely requiring an additional tool or script to copy, upgrade and remove dependencies.</li>\n<li>It’s more difficult to contribute upstream (particularly if import rewriting is one-way). If upstream contributions are frequent, this option may be less appealing.</li>\n<li>This solution applies well to applications, but it’s not clear how to better manage dependencies of a <em>library</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Resources:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.goinggo.net/2013/10/manage-dependencies-with-godep.html\">Manage Dependencies With Godep</a> by William Kennedy</li>\n</ul>\n\n<figure data-tooltip=\"Photograph © 2015 Nathan Youngman\" data-tooltip2=\"Go gopher designed by Renée French\">\n    <img alt=\"Gophers with pliers and packing tape.\" class=\"full\" src=\"https://nathany.com/images/gopher-packaging-tools.jpg\">\n    <figcaption>Not all these tools are appropriate for the job.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-right-tool:abd56199fec422fd375b8f010dd9a93f\">The Right Tool</h2>\n\n<p>Most language ecosystems have settled on one tool for versioning packages. Yet it’s worth noting that Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto isn’t the driving force behind Bundler, nor is Guido van Rossum the BDFL for Pip. Members of the community built these tools, and in time they became established as the <em>standard.</em></p>\n\n<p>Go itself doesn’t mandate a one-size-fits-all solution:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Versioning is a source of significant complexity, especially in large code bases, and we are unaware of any approach that works well at scale in a large enough variety of situations to be appropriate to force on all Go users.” - <a href=\"http://golang.org/doc/faq#get_version\">Go FAQ</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Using <code>go get</code> or copying dependencies into a <code>vendor</code> folder are the approaches endorsed by the Go Team.</p>\n\n<p>Others have simply forked all their dependencies to control when upgrades occur. Some have built tools to checkout dependencies with SHA revision identifiers. Still others utilize DVCS features like <a href=\"http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Submodules\">submodules</a> or <a href=\"http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Subtree-Merging\">subtree merging</a>. Experiment, find what works for you.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>go</code> tool provides a place for newcomers to start and some conventions to build upon.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“One of the virtues of the Go tool is that it uses Git, Mercurial, Subversion, Bazaar…” - Andrew Gerrand, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9VUCp98ay4&amp;t=37m42s\">Go Fireside Chat 2013</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>By convention, <code>go get</code> will create the folder <code>$GOPATH/src/github.com/howeyc/fsnotify</code> for the code retrieved from <code>github.com/howeyc/fsnotify</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The compiler actually doesn’t care where the source code came from. As long as the package can be found at <code>$GOPATH/src/github.com/howeyc/fsnotify</code>, it’s absolutely fine if the code actually came from a fork at <code>github.com/mycompany/fsnotify</code> or a mirror at <code>code.google.com/p/go.exp/fsnotify</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Adding remotes, checking out tags, all the usual DVCS operations are fair game.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-next-big-thing:abd56199fec422fd375b8f010dd9a93f\">The Next Big Thing</h2>\n\n<p>So you have an idea that will <mark>revolutionize</mark> how we <code>go get</code> packages?</p>\n\n<p>First, join the <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/go-package-management\">GoPM mailing list</a>, share your passion, and find out what others are working on.

Recognize that <mark>Go is different.</mark></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"no-npm:abd56199fec422fd375b8f010dd9a93f\">No NPM</h4>\n\n<p>NPM has a unique strategy for handling multiple versions. Each module requires the versions it wants, which may result in multiple versions of the same module being used in an application. This works well for JavaScript, but Go is not JavaScript.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond bloating up executables, the issues will vary from package to package. Different versions may compete for exclusive access to the same file, same port or other resources. Values of <code>interface</code> types may be compatible across both versions of the package, while values of other types won’t be implicitly interchangeable. The <code>init()</code> functions will be called for both packages, and there will be distinct versions of top-level variables and all global state. <em>Thanks to Kyle Lemons and John Waycott for <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/5Mr6A8zK6Kk\">making the issues concrete</a>.</em></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"no-bundler:abd56199fec422fd375b8f010dd9a93f\">No Bundler</h4>\n\n<p>Those coming from the Ruby on Rails community may remember copying third-party plugins into the <code>vendor</code> folder in the days before Bundler. Surely Go has something more <em>“sophisticated”</em> than that?</p>\n\n<p>As you read above, the approach used by Google actually has a number of strengths. It won’t be suitable for every situation, but the apparent simplicity and increased repository size shouldn’t deter you from trying it.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s remember that Bundler’s approach isn’t without flaws:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The story of <a href=\"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/9492\">Sprockets 2.2 backport</a> is a case where one gem took control away from developers, requiring a hacky workaround.</li>\n<li>Central repositories <a href=\"http://blog.nodejs.org/2013/11/26/npm-post-mortem/\">go down</a>, <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5139583\">get hacked</a> and are costly to run.</li>\n<li>Different permissions for those who can commit and those who can publish a gem have resulted in gems without a recent release.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>More importantly, such a tool my never gain sufficient traction if existing Go packages are expected to contain version metadata for it to work.

Building on top of DVCS is a brilliant move. There is a lovely <em>immediacy</em> to pulling in a dependency. <mark>Import and go.</mark></p>\n\n<p>Package managers like <a href=\"http://bundler.io/\">Bundler</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pip-installer.org/\">Pip</a> and <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.org/\">NPM</a> all have some mechanism to bypass their central repositories and pull code directly from source control. The go tool makes this first-class.</p>\n\n<p>When I want to contribute to an upstream package, those other tools force me to reconfigure my project. With the go tool, I switch to the package’s directory, make a change and test it out. Sending a pull request is just a few steps away. <mark>Open source collaboration made simple.</mark></p>\n\n<p>For hobbyists and those starting out, the go tool is all you need.</p>\n\n<p>Resources:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://golang.org/doc/code.html\">How to Write Go Code</a> (golang.org)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.goinggo.net/2013/08/organizing-code-to-support-go-get.html\">Organizing Code to Support Go Get</a> by William Kennedy</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The simplicity of the go tool does come with its trade-offs.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I want to have reproducible builds on different computers at different times.  This is currently problematic; let’s make things better.” - David Hinkes, <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/115983116618286597159/posts/gczN5SQ94ek\">Go+</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><code>Go get</code> does not have an explicit concept of versions. Members of a team may be importing different revisions <em>(version skew)</em>. Dependencies may introduce incompatibilities or security vulnerabilities, or even change licenses or disappear. For these reasons, it’s desirable to have more control over the upgrade process when building a real-world application.</p>\n\n<figure data-tooltip=\"Photograph © 2015 Nathan Youngman\" data-tooltip2=\"Go gopher designed by Renée French\">\n    <img alt=\"A plate of packages.\" class=\"full\" src=\"https://nathany.com/images/gopher-vendor.jpg\">\n    <figcaption>I had some packages for lunch and now they are part of me.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<h2 id=\"vendor-your-dependencies:abd56199fec422fd375b8f010dd9a93f\">Vendor Your Dependencies</h2>\n\n<p>Large companies like Google and Facebook do most development in a single giant repository. This enables massive refactors in a single commit, such as changing an API and every use of it.</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to third-party dependencies, the Go Team <a href=\"http://golang.org/doc/faq#get_version\">recommends</a> copying them into the source tree:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“If you’re using an externally supplied package and worry that it might change in unexpected ways, the simplest solution is to copy it to your local repository. (This is the approach Google takes internally.) Store the copy under a new import path that identifies it as a local copy. For example, you might copy <code>original.com/pkg</code> to <code>you.com/external/original.com/pkg</code>.” - <a href=\"http://golang.org/doc/faq#get_version\">Go FAQ</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is no need for a central archive of every version of every Go library ever released. Dependencies may move or disappear in the world outside your project, but your project has a copy of the dependencies it needs at any given point in history. Brad Fitzpatrick <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9VUCp98ay4&amp;t=36m55s\">describes this</a> as a <mark>“hermetic view of the world”</mark>.</p>\n\n<p>How is travelling back through the history of your project useful? Martin Fowler describes some benefits in <a href=\"http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ReproducibleBuild.html\">ReproducibleBuild</a>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>To reproduce a bug on the release branch that doesn’t happen on master.</li>\n<li>Using <code>bisect</code> to isolate the commit that introduced a bug.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It’s possible to upgrade dependencies in a controlled and tested manner, resolving all the stated issues with <code>go get</code>.</p>\n\n<p>So what are the trade-offs?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Compared to <code>go get</code>, it is a little more complicated, likely requiring an additional tool or script to copy, upgrade and remove dependencies.</li>\n<li>It’s more difficult to contribute upstream (particularly if import rewriting is one-way).

Yet it’s worth noting that Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto isn’t the driving force behind Bundler, nor is Guido van Rossum the BDFL for Pip. Members of the community built these tools, and in time they became established as the <em>standard.</em></p>\n\n<p>Go itself doesn’t mandate a one-size-fits-all solution:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Versioning is a source of significant complexity, especially in large code bases, and we are unaware of any approach that works well at scale in a large enough variety of situations to be appropriate to force on all Go users.” - <a href=\"http://golang.org/doc/faq#get_version\">Go FAQ</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Using <code>go get</code> or copying dependencies into a <code>vendor</code> folder are the approaches endorsed by the Go Team.</p>\n\n<p>Others have simply forked all their dependencies to control when upgrades occur. Some have built tools to checkout dependencies with SHA revision identifiers. Still others utilize DVCS features like <a href=\"http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Submodules\">submodules</a> or <a href=\"http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Subtree-Merging\">subtree merging</a>. Experiment, find what works for you.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>go</code> tool provides a place for newcomers to start and some conventions to build upon.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“One of the virtues of the Go tool is that it uses Git, Mercurial, Subversion, Bazaar…” - Andrew Gerrand, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9VUCp98ay4&amp;t=37m42s\">Go Fireside Chat 2013</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>By convention, <code>go get</code> will create the folder <code>$GOPATH/src/github.com/howeyc/fsnotify</code> for the code retrieved from <code>github.com/howeyc/fsnotify</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The compiler actually doesn’t care where the source code came from. As long as the package can be found at <code>$GOPATH/src/github.com/howeyc/fsnotify</code>, it’s absolutely fine if the code actually came from a fork at <code>github.com/mycompany/fsnotify</code> or a mirror at <code>code.google.com/p/go.exp/fsnotify</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Adding remotes, checking out tags, all the usual DVCS operations are fair game.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-next-big-thing:abd56199fec422fd375b8f010dd9a93f\">The Next Big Thing</h2>\n\n<p>So you have an idea that will <mark>revolutionize</mark> how we <code>go get</code> packages?</p>\n\n<p>First, join the <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/go-package-management\">GoPM mailing list</a>, share your passion, and find out what others are working on.

Each module requires the versions it wants, which may result in multiple versions of the same module being used in an application. This works well for JavaScript, but Go is not JavaScript.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond bloating up executables, the issues will vary from package to package. Different versions may compete for exclusive access to the same file, same port or other resources. Values of <code>interface</code> types may be compatible across both versions of the package, while values of other types won’t be implicitly interchangeable. The <code>init()</code> functions will be called for both packages, and there will be distinct versions of top-level variables and all global state. <em>Thanks to Kyle Lemons and John Waycott for <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/5Mr6A8zK6Kk\">making the issues concrete</a>.</em></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"no-bundler:abd56199fec422fd375b8f010dd9a93f\">No Bundler</h4>\n\n<p>Those coming from the Ruby on Rails community may remember copying third-party plugins into the <code>vendor</code> folder in the days before Bundler. Surely Go has something more <em>“sophisticated”</em> than that?</p>\n\n<p>As you read above, the approach used by Google actually has a number of strengths. It won’t be suitable for every situation, but the apparent simplicity and increased repository size shouldn’t deter you from trying it.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s remember that Bundler’s approach isn’t without flaws:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The story of <a href=\"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/9492\">Sprockets 2.2 backport</a> is a case where one gem took control away from developers, requiring a hacky workaround.</li>\n<li>Central repositories <a href=\"http://blog.nodejs.org/2013/11/26/npm-post-mortem/\">go down</a>, <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5139583\">get hacked</a> and are costly to run.</li>\n<li>Different permissions for those who can commit and those who can publish a gem have resulted in gems without a recent release.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>More importantly, such a tool my never gain sufficient traction if existing Go packages are expected to contain version metadata for it to work. Even if it is technically feasible, “Bundler for Go” may not be culturally suitable. <mark>When in Go do as the gophers do.</mark></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"keep-it-simple:abd56199fec422fd375b8f010dd9a93f\">Keep It Simple</h3>\n\n<p>Handling dependencies is incredibly important to the Go Team, even more important than <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself\">DRY</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Through the design of the standard library, great effort was spent on controlling dependencies.

So can a language without classes or objects be object-oriented?</p>\n\n<p>While Go may not fit the typical mold of an OOP language, it does provide many of the same features, albeit in a slightly different way:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>methods <mark>on any type</mark> we define, with no boxing or unboxing</li>\n<li>automatic message delegation via <mark>embedding</mark></li>\n<li>polymorphism via <mark>interfaces</mark></li>\n<li>namespacing via <mark>exports</mark></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There is <a href=\"http://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article#TOC_15.\">no inheritance</a> in Go, so leave those <em>is-a</em> relationships at the door. To write Go, we need to think about OO design in terms of <strong>composition</strong>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Use of classical inheritance is always optional; every problem that it solves can be solved another way.” - <a href=\"http://www.poodr.info/\">Sandi Metz</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"composition-by-example:64cb783befb167a018f30278036e9179\">Composition by Example</h2>\n\n<p>Having recently <a href=\"https://nathany.com/poodr\">read</a> through <a href=\"http://www.poodr.info/\">Practical Object-Oriented Programming in Ruby</a>, I decided to <a href=\"https://github.com/nathany/go-poodr/\">translate</a> the examples to Go.</p>\n\n<p>Chapter 6 presents a simple problem. A mechanic needs to know which spare parts to bring on a bike trip, depending on which bikes have been rented. The problem can be solved using classical inheritance, where <code>MountainBike</code> and <code>RoadBike</code> are specializations of a <code>Bicycle</code> base class. Chapter 8 reworks the same example to <mark>use composition instead</mark>. I’m quite happy with how well this version <a href=\"https://github.com/nathany/go-poodr/blob/master/chapter8/parts3.go\">translated to Go</a>. Let’s take a look.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"packages:64cb783befb167a018f30278036e9179\">Packages</h3>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-go\" data-lang=\"go\"><span class=\"kn\">package</span> <span class=\"nx\">main</span>\n\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"s\">\"fmt\"</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Packages provide a namespace. The <code>main()</code> function of the <code>main</code> package is where a program begins. The <code>fmt</code> package provides string formatting functions.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"types:64cb783befb167a018f30278036e9179\">Types</h3>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-go\" data-lang=\"go\"><span class=\"kd\">type</span> <span class=\"nx\">Part</span> <span class=\"kd\">struct</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"nx\">Name</span>        <span class=\"kt\">string</span>\n    <span class=\"nx\">Description</span> <span class=\"kt\">string</span>\n    <span class=\"nx\">NeedsSpare</span>  <span class=\"kt\">bool</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>We define a new type named Part. This structure is very much like a C struct.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-go\" data-lang=\"go\"><span class=\"kd\">type</span> <span class=\"nx\">Parts</span> <span class=\"p\">[]</span><span class=\"nx\">Part</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>The Parts type is a <em>slice</em> of Part values. Slices are variable-length arrays, which are more common in Go than their fixed-length brethren.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"methods:64cb783befb167a018f30278036e9179\">Methods</h3>\n\n<p>We can declare methods on any user-defined type, so Parts can have <mark>all the behavior of slices, plus our own custom behavior.</mark></p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-go\" data-lang=\"go\"><span class=\"kd\">func</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">parts</span> <span class=\"nx\">Parts</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"nx\">Spares</span><span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">spares</span> <span class=\"nx\">Parts</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"nx\">_</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">part</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"k\">range</span> <span class=\"nx\">parts</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"nx\">part</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">NeedsSpare</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n            <span class=\"nx\">spares</span> <span class=\"p\">=</span> <span class=\"nb\">append</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">spares</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">part</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"nx\">spares</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>A method declaration in Go is just like a function, except it has an <mark>explicit receiver</mark>, declared immediately after <code>func</code>. This function also takes advantage of named return variables, pre-initializing spares for us.</p>\n\n<p>The method body is fairly straightforward. We iterate over parts, ignoring the index position (<code>_</code>), filtering the parts to return. The <code>append</code> <a href=\"http://golang.org/pkg/builtin/\">builtin</a> may need to allocate and return a larger slice, as we didn’t preallocate its capacity.</p>\n\n<p>This code isn’t nearly as elegant as <code>select</code> in Ruby. A functional filter <a href=\"https://gobyexample.com/collection-functions\">is possible in Go</a>, but it isn’t <a href=\"http://golang.org/pkg/builtin/\">builtin</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"embedding:64cb783befb167a018f30278036e9179\">Embedding</h3>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-go\" data-lang=\"go\"><span class=\"kd\">type</span> <span class=\"nx\">Bicycle</span> <span class=\"kd\">struct</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"nx\">Size</span> <span class=\"kt\">string</span>\n    <span class=\"nx\">Parts</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Bicycle is <em>composed of</em> a Size and Parts. By not specifying a named field for Parts, we make use of <a href=\"http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#embedding\">embedding</a>.

They are <mark>satisfied implicitly</mark>, unlike Java or C#, so interfaces can be defined for code we don’t own.</p>\n\n<p>Compared to duck typing, <mark>interfaces are statically checked</mark> and documented through their declaration, rather than through writing a series of <code>respond_to?</code> tests.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“It is impossible to create an abstraction unknowingly or by accident; in statically typed languages defining an interface is <em>always</em> intentional.” - <a href=\"http://www.poodr.info/\">Sandi Metz</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For a simple example, let’s say we didn’t want to print the NeedsSpare flag of Part. We could write a String method as such:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-go\" data-lang=\"go\"><span class=\"kd\">func</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">part</span> <span class=\"nx\">Part</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"nx\">String</span><span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"kt\">string</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"nx\">fmt</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">Sprintf</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">\"%s: %s\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">part</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">Name</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">part</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">Description</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Then the calls to <code>Println</code> above would output this instead:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span class=\"k\">[chain: 10-speed tire_size: 23 tape_color: red]</span>\n<span class=\"k\">[chain: 10-speed tire_size: 2.1 rear_shock: Fox]</span>\n<span class=\"k\">[chain: 9-speed tire_size: 28 flag: tall and orange]</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>This works because we have satisfied the Stringer interface, which the <code>fmt</code> package makes use of. It is defined as:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-go\" data-lang=\"go\"><span class=\"kd\">type</span> <span class=\"nx\">Stringer</span> <span class=\"kd\">interface</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"nx\">String</span><span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"kt\">string</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Interface types can be used in the same places as other types. Variables and arguments can take a Stringer, which accepts anything that implements the <code>String() string</code> method signature.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"exports:64cb783befb167a018f30278036e9179\">Exports</h2>\n\n<p>Go uses packages for namespacing. Exported identifiers begin with a capital letter. To make an identifier internal to a package, we start it with a lowercase letter:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-go\" data-lang=\"go\"><span class=\"kd\">type</span> <span class=\"nx\">Part</span> <span class=\"kd\">struct</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"nx\">name</span>        <span class=\"kt\">string</span>\n    <span class=\"nx\">description</span> <span class=\"kt\">string</span>\n    <span class=\"nx\">needsSpare</span>  <span class=\"kt\">bool</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Then we could export setter and getter methods:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-go\" data-lang=\"go\"><span class=\"kd\">func</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">part</span> <span class=\"nx\">Part</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"nx\">Name</span><span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"kt\">string</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"nx\">part</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">name</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"kd\">func</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">part</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"nx\">Part</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"nx\">SetName</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">name</span> <span class=\"kt\">string</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"nx\">part</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">name</span> <span class=\"p\">=</span> <span class=\"nx\">name</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>It’s easy to determine what is using the public API vs. internal fields or methods. Just look at the case of the identifier (eg. <code>part.Name()</code> vs. <code>part.name</code>).</p>\n\n<p>Notice that we don’t prefix <a href=\"http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#Getters\">getters</a> with Get (eg. <code>GetName</code>). Getters aren’t strictly necessary either, especially with strings. When the need arises, we can always change the Name field to use a custom type that satisfies the Stringer interface.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"finding-some-privacy:64cb783befb167a018f30278036e9179\">Finding Some Privacy</h3>\n\n<p>Internal names (<code>lowerCase</code>) can be accessed from anywhere in the same package, even if the package contains multiple structs across multiple files. If you find this unsettling, packages can also be as small as you need.</p>\n\n<p>It is good practice to use the <em>(more stable)</em> public API when possible, even from within the same class in classical languages. Go’s use of capitalization\nmakes it easy to see where this is the case.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"for-great-good:64cb783befb167a018f30278036e9179\">For Great GOOD</h2>\n\n<p>Composition, embedding and interfaces provide powerful tools for Object-Oriented Design in Go.</p>\n\n<p>While Idiomatic Go requires a change in thinking, I am pleasantly surprised with how simple and concise Go code can be when playing to its strengths.</p>\n\n<p><em>Comment on <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/104313268939103200754/posts/Q59rppGdyUR\">Go+</a>, <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6392545\">Hacker News</a>, <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/16lli8/go_object_oriented_design/\">reddit</a>, <a href=\"http://lnkd.in/mxNfUb\">LinkedIn</a>, or the <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/topic/golang-nuts/OWINbSIe5hc/discussion\">Go Nuts mailing list</a>.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“So few people realize that classes and inheritance are mostly historic accidents and not real needs for good OOD.” - Javier Guerra via Go+</p>\n\n<p>“This is excellent stuff.

A mechanic needs to know which spare parts to bring on a bike trip, depending on which bikes have been rented. The problem can be solved using classical inheritance, where <code>MountainBike</code> and <code>RoadBike</code> are specializations of a <code>Bicycle</code> base class. Chapter 8 reworks the same example to <mark>use composition instead</mark>. I’m quite happy with how well this version <a href=\"https://github.com/nathany/go-poodr/blob/master/chapter8/parts3.go\">translated to Go</a>. Let’s take a look.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"packages:64cb783befb167a018f30278036e9179\">Packages</h3>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-go\" data-lang=\"go\"><span class=\"kn\">package</span> <span class=\"nx\">main</span>\n\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"s\">\"fmt\"</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Packages provide a namespace.

This function also takes advantage of named return variables, pre-initializing spares for us.</p>\n\n<p>The method body is fairly straightforward. We iterate over parts, ignoring the index position (<code>_</code>), filtering the parts to return. The <code>append</code> <a href=\"http://golang.org/pkg/builtin/\">builtin</a> may need to allocate and return a larger slice, as we didn’t preallocate its capacity.</p>\n\n<p>This code isn’t nearly as elegant as <code>select</code> in Ruby.

This may <em>feel</em> like inheritance, but <mark>embedding does <strong>not</strong> provide polymorphism.</mark> The receiver for methods on Parts will always be of type Parts, even when delegated through Bicycle.</p>\n\n<p>Patterns used with classical inheritance, like the template method pattern, aren’t suitable for embedding. It’s far better to think in terms of composition &amp; delegation, as we have here.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"composite-literals:64cb783befb167a018f30278036e9179\">Composite Literals</h3>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-go\" data-lang=\"go\"><span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span>\n    <span class=\"nx\">RoadBikeParts</span> <span class=\"p\">=</span> <span class=\"nx\">Parts</span><span class=\"p\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"s\">\"chain\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">\"10-speed\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"kc\">true</span><span class=\"p\">},</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"s\">\"tire_size\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">\"23\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"kc\">true</span><span class=\"p\">},</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"s\">\"tape_color\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">\"red\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"kc\">true</span><span class=\"p\">},</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n    <span class=\"nx\">MountainBikeParts</span> <span class=\"p\">=</span> <span class=\"nx\">Parts</span><span class=\"p\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"s\">\"chain\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">\"10-speed\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"kc\">true</span><span class=\"p\">},</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"s\">\"tire_size\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">\"2.1\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"kc\">true</span><span class=\"p\">},</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"s\">\"front_shock\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">\"Manitou\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"kc\">false</span><span class=\"p\">},</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"s\">\"rear_shock\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">\"Fox\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"kc\">true</span><span class=\"p\">},</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n    <span class=\"nx\">RecumbentBikeParts</span> <span class=\"p\">=</span> <span class=\"nx\">Parts</span><span class=\"p\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"s\">\"chain\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">\"9-speed\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"kc\">true</span><span class=\"p\">},</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"s\">\"tire_size\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">\"28\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"kc\">true</span><span class=\"p\">},</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"s\">\"flag\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">\"tall and orange\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"kc\">true</span><span class=\"p\">},</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Go provides a nice syntax for initializing values, called <a href=\"http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#composite_literals\">composite literals</a>.

Getting the length, slicing the slice, or combining multiple slices all works as usual.</p>\n\n<p>It would seem that the equivalent solution in Ruby is to subclass Array, but unfortunately Ruby “misplaces” the spares method when two Parts are concatenated (update: Steve Klabnik <a href=\"http://words.steveklabnik.com/beware-subclassing-ruby-core-classes\">goes into detail</a>).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>”…in a perfect object-oriented language this solution would be exactly correct. Unfortunately, the Ruby language has not quite achieved perfection…” - <a href=\"http://www.poodr.info/\">Sandi Metz</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"interfaces:64cb783befb167a018f30278036e9179\">Interfaces</h2>\n\n<p>Polymorphism in Go is provided by interfaces. They are <mark>satisfied implicitly</mark>, unlike Java or C#, so interfaces can be defined for code we don’t own.</p>\n\n<p>Compared to duck typing, <mark>interfaces are statically checked</mark> and documented through their declaration, rather than through writing a series of <code>respond_to?</code> tests.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“It is impossible to create an abstraction unknowingly or by accident; in statically typed languages defining an interface is <em>always</em> intentional.” - <a href=\"http://www.poodr.info/\">Sandi Metz</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For a simple example, let’s say we didn’t want to print the NeedsSpare flag of Part. We could write a String method as such:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-go\" data-lang=\"go\"><span class=\"kd\">func</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">part</span> <span class=\"nx\">Part</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"nx\">String</span><span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"kt\">string</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"nx\">fmt</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">Sprintf</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">\"%s: %s\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">part</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">Name</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">part</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">Description</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Then the calls to <code>Println</code> above would output this instead:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span class=\"k\">[chain: 10-speed tire_size: 23 tape_color: red]</span>\n<span class=\"k\">[chain: 10-speed tire_size: 2.1 rear_shock: Fox]</span>\n<span class=\"k\">[chain: 9-speed tire_size: 28 flag: tall and orange]</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>This works because we have satisfied the Stringer interface, which the <code>fmt</code> package makes use of. It is defined as:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-go\" data-lang=\"go\"><span class=\"kd\">type</span> <span class=\"nx\">Stringer</span> <span class=\"kd\">interface</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"nx\">String</span><span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"kt\">string</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Interface types can be used in the same places as other types. Variables and arguments can take a Stringer, which accepts anything that implements the <code>String() string</code> method signature.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"exports:64cb783befb167a018f30278036e9179\">Exports</h2>\n\n<p>Go uses packages for namespacing. Exported identifiers begin with a capital letter. To make an identifier internal to a package, we start it with a lowercase letter:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-go\" data-lang=\"go\"><span class=\"kd\">type</span> <span class=\"nx\">Part</span> <span class=\"kd\">struct</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"nx\">name</span>        <span class=\"kt\">string</span>\n    <span class=\"nx\">description</span> <span class=\"kt\">string</span>\n    <span class=\"nx\">needsSpare</span>  <span class=\"kt\">bool</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Then we could export setter and getter methods:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-go\" data-lang=\"go\"><span class=\"kd\">func</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">part</span> <span class=\"nx\">Part</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"nx\">Name</span><span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"kt\">string</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"nx\">part</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">name</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"kd\">func</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">part</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"nx\">Part</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"nx\">SetName</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">name</span> <span class=\"kt\">string</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"nx\">part</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">name</span> <span class=\"p\">=</span> <span class=\"nx\">name</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>It’s easy to determine what is using the public API vs. internal fields or methods. Just look at the case of the identifier (eg. <code>part.Name()</code> vs. <code>part.name</code>).</p>\n\n<p>Notice that we don’t prefix <a href=\"http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#Getters\">getters</a> with Get (eg. <code>GetName</code>). Getters aren’t strictly necessary either, especially with strings. When the need arises, we can always change the Name field to use a custom type that satisfies the Stringer interface.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"finding-some-privacy:64cb783befb167a018f30278036e9179\">Finding Some Privacy</h3>\n\n<p>Internal names (<code>lowerCase</code>) can be accessed from anywhere in the same package, even if the package contains multiple structs across multiple files. If you find this unsettling, packages can also be as small as you need.</p>\n\n<p>It is good practice to use the <em>(more stable)</em> public API when possible, even from within the same class in classical languages. Go’s use of capitalization\nmakes it easy to see where this is the case.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"for-great-good:64cb783befb167a018f30278036e9179\">For Great GOOD</h2>\n\n<p>Composition, embedding and interfaces provide powerful tools for Object-Oriented Design in Go.</p>\n\n<p>While Idiomatic Go requires a change in thinking, I am pleasantly surprised with how simple and concise Go code can be when playing to its strengths.</p>\n\n<p><em>Comment on <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/104313268939103200754/posts/Q59rppGdyUR\">Go+</a>, <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6392545\">Hacker News</a>, <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/16lli8/go_object_oriented_design/\">reddit</a>, <a href=\"http://lnkd.in/mxNfUb\">LinkedIn</a>, or the <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/topic/golang-nuts/OWINbSIe5hc/discussion\">Go Nuts mailing list</a>.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“So few people realize that classes and inheritance are mostly historic accidents and not real needs for good OOD.” - Javier Guerra via Go+</p>\n\n<p>“This is excellent stuff.

Before migrating our <em>production</em> database at <a href=\"http://getjobber.com/\">Jobber</a>, we want to run it in development for a few days.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve been using <a href=\"http://postgresapp.com/\">Postgres.app</a> on my Mac for a while now. Patches are seamless, but migrating from 9.1 to 9.2 takes some command line acrobatics. The <a href=\"http://postgresapp.com/documentation\">documentation</a> sets you on the right track, but I ran into a few gotchas.</p>\n\n<p><em>These instructions are for upgrading to Version 9.2.2.0 (20). If you have a newer version, things may have improved!</em></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Keep your old copy of Postgres.app, you’ll need it. After Quitting, move it to the desktop.</li>\n<li>Download the new version of <a href=\"http://postgresapp.com/\">Postgres.app</a> and install it to Applications.</li>\n<li>Launch the new version of Postgres. You need the <em>right-click+open</em> trick on Mountain Lion to get around Gatekeeper. It will move your old database files to a <code>var-9.1</code> folder and initialize a new database in its place.</li>\n<li>Fiddle in <code>psql</code> to prepare the new database (see below).</li>\n<li>Quit out of Postgres.app and perform the upgrade.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2 id=\"database-already-exists:7ef3c04ee2534691a5e769e54d50f215\">Database already exists</h2>\n\n<p>My first attempt failed.</p>\n\n<p>The new data files already had a <code>nathany</code> database (my username), so <code>pg_upgrade</code> couldn’t create it. I’m sure there are a few ways to solve this problem, depending on whether or not you want to migrate this database or discard it. Let’s keep it.</p>\n\n<p>We’ll need to use <code>psql</code> with the <strong>new</strong> Postgres.app running.

While anyone can read “what’s new” in <a href=\"http://docs.python.org/2.6/whatsnew/2.6.html\">2.6</a> and <a href=\"http://docs.python.org/3.0/whatsnew/3.0.html\">3.0</a>, his talk brought some clarity to the benefits of these changes.</p>\n\n<p>Using my notes, I’ll do my best to summarize what we learned. Please keep in mind that I’m still a Python amateur, and some things were way over my head.</p>\n\n<p>Brett started with what’s <strong>new in 2.6</strong>, like the <code>format()</code> method with a nicer, more flexible syntax than print %. For example, positional arguments can be in any order, and can be repeated:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-python\" data-lang=\"python\"><span class=\"s\">\"{1} {1} {0} {1} {1}\"</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">format</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">'future'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">'under'</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"c\"># =&gt; under under future under under</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Now any object can support splicing by defining the <code>__index__</code> method. <strong>Abstract Base Classes</strong> (ABC) can be used to register what a class implements. <strong>Class @decorators</strong> add function <code>@decorator</code> like post-processing to classes, providing a simpler mechanism than MetaClasses for many cases.</p>\n\n<p><strong>New modules</strong> include io, <a href=\"http://undefined.org/python/#simplejson\">simplejson</a> as json, <a href=\"http://pyprocessing.berlios.de/\">PyProcessing</a> as multiprocessing, and the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) module. AST could be useful for implementing something like C#’s LINQ or Ruby’s <a href=\"http://sequel.rubyforge.org/\">Sequel</a>, as well as for templating languages in the vein of <a href=\"http://breve.twisty-industries.com/\">Brevé</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Many of the changes help ease the transition to 3.0, such as the -3 flag for extra warnings. <a href=\"http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0370/\">Per user site-packages directories</a> make it simple to use (test) the same code with multiple interpreters. You can adopt Python 3.0 behavior in 2.6, for example <code>from __future__ import true_division</code>  causes the division operator to return a float (the <code>//</code> operator returns a truncated integer).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"bits-and-bytes:66099e923b085685d94379afc3dd53d2\">Bits and Bytes</h2>\n\n<p>Perhaps the most obvious change in Python 3.0 is that the <strong>Unicode</strong> type is replacing the old string type. For binary data there is a bytes type. In Python 2.6, bytes is an alias for the str type, such that:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-python\" data-lang=\"python\"><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">b</span><span class=\"s\">'a'</span> <span class=\"o\">==</span> <span class=\"s\">'a'</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"c\"># =&gt; True</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Python 3.0 introduces an entirely different bytes type, so <em>this is <strong>not</strong> the case.</em></p>\n\n<p>For performance reasons Unicode strings are stored in UTF-16 internally, but you will likely stick with UTF-8 and let Python take care of the translation. Source code and identifiers can also use Unicode, though only to a certain point. I’m not sure if <code>שׁלוֹם = 'peace'</code> will work, but this is mainly there to help <a href=\"http://wiki.laptop.org/go/OLPC_Python_Environment\">OLPC</a> kids learn Python.</p>\n\n<p>The mutable counterpart for <code>bytes</code> is the <code>bytearray</code> type. There is also a memoryview planned to replace buffers.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"data-structures:66099e923b085685d94379afc3dd53d2\">Data Structures</h2>\n\n<p>Moving on to Python 3 specific enhancements, list <strong>comprehensions</strong> have been generalized to apply to dictionaries and sets as well. Sets also have a literal form, <code>{1,2,3}</code>, essentially an unordered dictionary with no values.</p>\n\n<p>When <a href=\"http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3132/\">unpacking</a> a list, you can use <strong>star unpacking</strong> to capture any other elements, whether from the beginning, middle or end:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-python\" data-lang=\"python\"><span class=\"n\">head</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"n\">tail</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">some_list</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<h2 id=\"functions:66099e923b085685d94379afc3dd53d2\">Functions</h2>\n\n<p>Keyword arguments are handy for APIs with many options. Python 3.0  introduces <strong>keyword-only arguments</strong> which are especially useful for booleans where <code>True</code> by itself is meaningless. Define <code>func(*, load=True)</code>, and any keyword arguments after the * cannot be specified positionally.</p>\n\n<p>Function <strong>annotations</strong> can be used for type checking (param:int) via a @decorator, but could find uses in documenting parameters.</p>\n\n<p>There is some new MetaClass stuff, but I really didn’t follow.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"true-closures:66099e923b085685d94379afc3dd53d2\">True Closures</h2>\n\n<p>Having learned <a href=\"https://nathany.com/vanpyz/lua\">Lua</a> last year, I was happy when the closures came up. I recently had to do a <em>little hack</em> to get a closure in Python 2.5:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-python\" data-lang=\"python\"><span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">parse_footnotes</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">text</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n  <span class=\"sd\">\"\"\"Converts my custom style footnotes to Markdown Extra format\"\"\"</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">count</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>       <span class=\"c\"># using a list is a trick to do closures in Python</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">footnotes</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[]</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">handle_match</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">mo</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n    <span class=\"sd\">\"\"\"replace matched {fn ...} with [^1]\"\"\"</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">count</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"o\">+=</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">footnotes</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">append</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">mo</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">group</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">mo</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">lastindex</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>    <span class=\"c\"># store footnote for later</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"s\">u'[^</span><span class=\"si\">%d</span><span class=\"s\">]'</span> <span class=\"o\">%</span> <span class=\"n\">count</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n\n  <span class=\"o\">...</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>In this example, I am writing a callback to process each match for a regular expression, and return the substitute value. I needed to keep a count in order to return <code>[^1]</code>, <code>[^2]</code>, etc. Writing a class for this is a little excessive, a closure is just right.</p>\n\n<p>Python 3.0 introduces the <a href=\"http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3104/\">nonlocal</a> keyword, that works in a similar fashion to <code>global</code>. The above code could be written like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-python\" data-lang=\"python\"><span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">parse_footnotes</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">text</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n  <span class=\"sd\">\"\"\"Converts my custom style footnotes to Markdown Extra format\"\"\"</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">count</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">footnotes</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[]</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">handle_match</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">mo</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n    <span class=\"sd\">\"\"\"replace matched {fn ...} with [^1]\"\"\"</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">nonlocal</span> <span class=\"n\">count</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">count</span> <span class=\"o\">+=</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">footnotes</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">append</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">mo</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">group</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">mo</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">lastindex</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>    <span class=\"c\"># store footnote for later</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"s\">'[^{0:d}]'</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">format</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">count</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n  <span class=\"o\">...</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<h2 id=\"exceptions:66099e923b085685d94379afc3dd53d2\">Exceptions</h2>\n\n<p>Exceptions received quite an overhaul, not only adopting a consistent syntax, exceptions can also be <strong>chained</strong>. If an exception occurs while handling another exception, the original exception is not lost, and the traceback is tied to each exception object.</p>\n\n<p>BaseException is at the root, and KeyboardInterrupt, SystemError and Exception inherit from that. You can catch Exception and let the other two fall through for the interpreter to handle.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"refactoring:66099e923b085685d94379afc3dd53d2\">Refactoring</h2>\n\n<p>Brett Cannon did the major overhaul of the <strong>standard library</strong>, moving related modules into packages, dropping unmaintained OS modules, and renaming things to make more sense.</p>\n\n<p>Relative imports have gone away, save for <code>from . import ...</code>.</p>\n\n<p>There are several minor changes that break backwards-compatibility, like <code>raw_input</code> becomes <code>input</code>, and <code>xrange</code> becomes <code>range</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>open()</code> builtin uses the new io module, whereas 2.6 uses old io unless you write <code>io.open()</code>.</p>\n\n<p>All these sorts of changes should be handled by running <strong>2to3</strong> after taking care of any deprecation warnings when running under 2.6 with the -3 flag.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"summary:66099e923b085685d94379afc3dd53d2\">Summary</h2>\n\n<p>Python 2.6 and 3.0 are presently scheduled for an October release. The changes in 3.0 look like really good improvements that move the language forward.</p>\n\n<p>Porting any one project to 3.0 shouldn’t take too long, it’s mainly an issue of prerequisites. One of Python’s major strengths is the vast library of third-party tools. You need to wait for, or get involved with the porting of any libraries you use before making the switch. That’s going to take some time.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, we need to be aware of the changes if we want the transition to be as smooth as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to Brett Cannon for his talk, and VanPyZ for hosting it.</p>",

For example, positional arguments can be in any order, and can be repeated:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-python\" data-lang=\"python\"><span class=\"s\">\"{1} {1} {0} {1} {1}\"</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">format</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">'future'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">'under'</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"c\"># =&gt; under under future under under</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Now any object can support splicing by defining the <code>__index__</code> method. <strong>Abstract Base Classes</strong> (ABC) can be used to register what a class implements. <strong>Class @decorators</strong> add function <code>@decorator</code> like post-processing to classes, providing a simpler mechanism than MetaClasses for many cases.</p>\n\n<p><strong>New modules</strong> include io, <a href=\"http://undefined.org/python/#simplejson\">simplejson</a> as json, <a href=\"http://pyprocessing.berlios.de/\">PyProcessing</a> as multiprocessing, and the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) module. AST could be useful for implementing something like C#’s LINQ or Ruby’s <a href=\"http://sequel.rubyforge.org/\">Sequel</a>, as well as for templating languages in the vein of <a href=\"http://breve.twisty-industries.com/\">Brevé</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Many of the changes help ease the transition to 3.0, such as the -3 flag for extra warnings. <a href=\"http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0370/\">Per user site-packages directories</a> make it simple to use (test) the same code with multiple interpreters. You can adopt Python 3.0 behavior in 2.6, for example <code>from __future__ import true_division</code>  causes the division operator to return a float (the <code>//</code> operator returns a truncated integer).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"bits-and-bytes:66099e923b085685d94379afc3dd53d2\">Bits and Bytes</h2>\n\n<p>Perhaps the most obvious change in Python 3.0 is that the <strong>Unicode</strong> type is replacing the old string type. For binary data there is a bytes type. In Python 2.6, bytes is an alias for the str type, such that:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-python\" data-lang=\"python\"><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">b</span><span class=\"s\">'a'</span> <span class=\"o\">==</span> <span class=\"s\">'a'</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"c\"># =&gt; True</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Python 3.0 introduces an entirely different bytes type, so <em>this is <strong>not</strong> the case.</em></p>\n\n<p>For performance reasons Unicode strings are stored in UTF-16 internally, but you will likely stick with UTF-8 and let Python take care of the translation. Source code and identifiers can also use Unicode, though only to a certain point. I’m not sure if <code>שׁלוֹם = 'peace'</code> will work, but this is mainly there to help <a href=\"http://wiki.laptop.org/go/OLPC_Python_Environment\">OLPC</a> kids learn Python.</p>\n\n<p>The mutable counterpart for <code>bytes</code> is the <code>bytearray</code> type. There is also a memoryview planned to replace buffers.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"data-structures:66099e923b085685d94379afc3dd53d2\">Data Structures</h2>\n\n<p>Moving on to Python 3 specific enhancements, list <strong>comprehensions</strong> have been generalized to apply to dictionaries and sets as well. Sets also have a literal form, <code>{1,2,3}</code>, essentially an unordered dictionary with no values.</p>\n\n<p>When <a href=\"http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3132/\">unpacking</a> a list, you can use <strong>star unpacking</strong> to capture any other elements, whether from the beginning, middle or end:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-python\" data-lang=\"python\"><span class=\"n\">head</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"n\">tail</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">some_list</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<h2 id=\"functions:66099e923b085685d94379afc3dd53d2\">Functions</h2>\n\n<p>Keyword arguments are handy for APIs with many options. Python 3.0  introduces <strong>keyword-only arguments</strong> which are especially useful for booleans where <code>True</code> by itself is meaningless. Define <code>func(*, load=True)</code>, and any keyword arguments after the * cannot be specified positionally.</p>\n\n<p>Function <strong>annotations</strong> can be used for type checking (param:int) via a @decorator, but could find uses in documenting parameters.</p>\n\n<p>There is some new MetaClass stuff, but I really didn’t follow.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"true-closures:66099e923b085685d94379afc3dd53d2\">True Closures</h2>\n\n<p>Having learned <a href=\"https://nathany.com/vanpyz/lua\">Lua</a> last year, I was happy when the closures came up. I recently had to do a <em>little hack</em> to get a closure in Python 2.5:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-python\" data-lang=\"python\"><span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">parse_footnotes</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">text</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n  <span class=\"sd\">\"\"\"Converts my custom style footnotes to Markdown Extra format\"\"\"</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">count</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>       <span class=\"c\"># using a list is a trick to do closures in Python</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">footnotes</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[]</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">handle_match</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">mo</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n    <span class=\"sd\">\"\"\"replace matched {fn ...} with [^1]\"\"\"</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">count</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"o\">+=</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">footnotes</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">append</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">mo</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">group</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">mo</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">lastindex</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>    <span class=\"c\"># store footnote for later</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"s\">u'[^</span><span class=\"si\">%d</span><span class=\"s\">]'</span> <span class=\"o\">%</span> <span class=\"n\">count</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n\n  <span class=\"o\">...</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>In this example, I am writing a callback to process each match for a regular expression, and return the substitute value. I needed to keep a count in order to return <code>[^1]</code>, <code>[^2]</code>, etc. Writing a class for this is a little excessive, a closure is just right.</p>\n\n<p>Python 3.0 introduces the <a href=\"http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3104/\">nonlocal</a> keyword, that works in a similar fashion to <code>global</code>. The above code could be written like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-python\" data-lang=\"python\"><span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">parse_footnotes</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">text</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n  <span class=\"sd\">\"\"\"Converts my custom style footnotes to Markdown Extra format\"\"\"</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">count</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">footnotes</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[]</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">handle_match</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">mo</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n    <span class=\"sd\">\"\"\"replace matched {fn ...} with [^1]\"\"\"</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">nonlocal</span> <span class=\"n\">count</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">count</span> <span class=\"o\">+=</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">footnotes</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">append</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">mo</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">group</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">mo</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">lastindex</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>    <span class=\"c\"># store footnote for later</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"s\">'[^{0:d}]'</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">format</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">count</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n  <span class=\"o\">...</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<h2 id=\"exceptions:66099e923b085685d94379afc3dd53d2\">Exceptions</h2>\n\n<p>Exceptions received quite an overhaul, not only adopting a consistent syntax, exceptions can also be <strong>chained</strong>. If an exception occurs while handling another exception, the original exception is not lost, and the traceback is tied to each exception object.</p>\n\n<p>BaseException is at the root, and KeyboardInterrupt, SystemError and Exception inherit from that. You can catch Exception and let the other two fall through for the interpreter to handle.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"refactoring:66099e923b085685d94379afc3dd53d2\">Refactoring</h2>\n\n<p>Brett Cannon did the major overhaul of the <strong>standard library</strong>, moving related modules into packages, dropping unmaintained OS modules, and renaming things to make more sense.</p>\n\n<p>Relative imports have gone away, save for <code>from . import ...</code>.</p>\n\n<p>There are several minor changes that break backwards-compatibility, like <code>raw_input</code> becomes <code>input</code>, and <code>xrange</code> becomes <code>range</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>open()</code> builtin uses the new io module, whereas 2.6 uses old io unless you write <code>io.open()</code>.</p>\n\n<p>All these sorts of changes should be handled by running <strong>2to3</strong> after taking care of any deprecation warnings when running under 2.6 with the -3 flag.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"summary:66099e923b085685d94379afc3dd53d2\">Summary</h2>\n\n<p>Python 2.6 and 3.0 are presently scheduled for an October release. The changes in 3.0 look like really good improvements that move the language forward.</p>\n\n<p>Porting any one project to 3.0 shouldn’t take too long, it’s mainly an issue of prerequisites. One of Python’s major strengths is the vast library of third-party tools. You need to wait for, or get involved with the porting of any libraries you use before making the switch. That’s going to take some time.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, we need to be aware of the changes if we want the transition to be as smooth as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to Brett Cannon for his talk, and VanPyZ for hosting it.</p>",

We now have all the information we need to implement a <code>valueLink</code>-style property on any component we write.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extrapolating-to-custom-components\">Extrapolating to Custom Components</h2>\n\n<p>Let’s build a simple React component that wraps a <a href=\"https://github.com/laktek/really-simple-color-picker\">simple jQuery color picker</a>.

            "description": "<p>If you haven’t heard, the fine folks at GitHub released <a href=\"http://atom.io/\">a text editor called Atom</a> into beta yesterday. As with any new tool or technology, reactions were mixed. I’ve been using Atom for about two months now, since the private alpha, and I’d like to tell you why I’m excited about this little editor.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://michelletilley.net/images/atom_screenshot.png\" alt=\"Atom Screenshot\"></p>\n\n<p>Atom is <a href=\"http://blog.atom.io/2014/02/26/the-nucleus-of-atom.html\">built on Chromium</a>; it is, essentially, a web application, running inside a dedicated browser. You might not even notice this fact at first glance—it runs like any other native app, has access to the file system, and does all the things you’d expect any other native app to do. But, under the hood, Atom leverages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for its UI and leans on <a href=\"http://nodejs.org/\">Node.js</a> for system-level APIs.</p>\n\n<p>This fact opens up lots of possibilities. Users can make simple customizations to their UI <a href=\"http://discuss.atom.io/t/atom-is-so-powerful-that-it-blows-my-mind/294\">with a few lines of CSS</a>. If you’re not sure what classes to override, just pop open the inspector and take a look.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://michelletilley.net/images/atom_inspector_ss.png\" alt=\"Atom Inspector\"></p>\n\n<p>Since packages are also <a href=\"https://github.com/atom/fuzzy-finder/\">written using HTML, CSS and JavaScript</a>, the barrier to creating packages is quite low compared with many other editors. Furthermore, the Node.js backing gives you the ability to use any of the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.org/\">more than 60,000 Node packages on npm</a>, as well as any of Node’s built-in APIs. Want to start a web server from your package? <a href=\"http://nodejs.org/api/http.html\">No problem</a>. Launch some external processes? <a href=\"http://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html\">Can do</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Really, since it’s all Chromium under the hood, the sky is the limit. Imagine the cool code visualization tools you could build using Canvas or WebGL. <a href=\"http://d3js.org/\">D3</a> and <a href=\"http://threejs.org/\">Three.js</a> in my editor? Yes, please!</p>\n\n<p>Plus, what editor lets you do this with two lines of code? :)</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://michelletilley.net/images/atom_flipped.png\" alt=\"Oops!\"></p>\n\n<p>In short, I feel Atom takes the Emacs mode of thinking—that your editor should be just as malleable as the code you write with it—and presents it in a fresh, modern way, ready to take on the web-based world. Give it a shot if you haven’t already; sign up for a beta invite <a href=\"http://atom.io/\">over at atom.io</a>.</p>",

            "description": "<p>Ever since reading <a href=\"https://github.com/blog/517-unicorn\">GitHub’s blog post on Unicorn</a>, I’ve been interested in trying it out. This post will document the process I used to get Unicorn serving a Rails application behind Nginx, with RVM&nbsp;managing Ruby. If you’ve read GitHub’s post, some of the config will look very familiar. Ideally, though, you should be able to follow this post from start to finish and have a working setup going.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h1>\n\n<p>I installed this setup on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Server Edition, 64-bit. You should be able to follow along pretty well on any sane system; that being said, I do use Upstart to manage the services toward the end of the guide. If you don’t use Upstart, you will need to substitute in your own SysVinit scripts (or scripts for whatever you use instead).</p>\n\n<p>In a few listings, I use curl with Gist URLs to fetch the contents of files; the contents of these files are shown below the shell commands, for reference.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"installing-rvm\">Installing RVM</h1>\n\n<p>Since we’ll use RVM to manage our Rubies and gemsets on the server, we’ll start with a server-wide install of RVM. We’ll start out by installing curl and git, if necessary, then RVM, and finally the other packages RVM asks us to install. (Be sure to pay attention to these; you can view them again via <code>rvm notes</code>. You may need to install additional packages for your distro of Linux or for the Rubies you wish to use). I’m using Ruby 1.9.2-p136 here.</p>\n\n<p>We’ll also take care to add the current user to the ‘rvm’ group. Finally, we’ll create a user called ‘unicorn’ to own our test application, later.</p>\n\n<gist data-id=\"802568\" data-file=\"00_rvm.sh\"></gist>\n<noscript><pre><code># Install RVM and dependencies\nsudo aptitude install curl git-core\nsudo bash &lt; &lt;( curl -L http://bit.ly/rvm-install-system-wide )\nsudo aptitude install build-essential bison openssl libreadline6 libreadline6-dev curl git-core zlib1g zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libyaml-dev libsqlite3-0 libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 libxml2-dev libxslt-dev autoconf libc6-dev\nsudo adduser `whoami` rvm\necho &#39;source /usr/local/lib/rvm&#39; &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc\n# Set up users and groups\nsudo useradd --home /var/www --create-home --groups rvm unicorn &amp;&amp; sudo chmod g+w /var/www\nsudo adduser `whoami` unicorn\n#\n# &gt;&gt; Log out and back in to SSH, open a new shell, etc. -- something to reload your environment\n#\n# Install Ruby 1.9.2-p136 and make it default\nrvm install ruby-1.9.2-p136\n# Make a sandwich while you wait (or have someone make you one: http://xkcd.com/149/)\nrvm use ruby-1.9.2-p136 --default</code></pre><div><small><em><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/802568\">View Gist for <code>00_rvm.sh</code> on GitHub</a></em></small></div></noscript>\n\n<h1 id=\"installing-and-configuring-nginx\">Installing and Configuring Nginx</h1>\n\n<p>For simplicity’s sake, we’ll be using Nginx from APT.

For most guests, however, the defining moments of the “Airbnb experience” happen in the real world – when they are traveling to their listing, being greeted by their host, settling into the listing, and exploring the destination. These are the moments that make or break the Airbnb experience, no matter how great we make our website. The purpose of this post is to show how we can use data to understand the quality of the trip experience, and in particular how the ‘Net promoter score’ adds value.</p>\n<p>Currently, the best information we can gather about the offline experience is from the review that guests complete on Airbnb.com after their trip ends. The review, which is optional, asks for textual feedback and rating scores from 1-5 for the overall experience as well as subcategories: Accuracy, Cleanliness, Checkin, Communication, Location, and Value. Starting at the end of 2013, we added one more question to our review form, the NPS question.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://nerds.airbnb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/photo1.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-176595364\" alt=\"photo1\" src=\"http://nerds.airbnb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/photo1.png\" width=\"444\" height=\"270\"></a></p>\n<p>NPS, or the “Net Promoter Score”, is a widely used customer loyalty metric introduced by Fred Reicheld in 2003 [<a href=\"https://hbr.org/2003/12/the-one-number-you-need-to-grow/ar/1\">https://hbr.org/2003/12/the-one-number-you-need-to-grow/ar/1</a>] . We ask guests “How likely are you to recommend Airbnb to a friend?” – a question called “likelihood to recommend” or LTR. Guests who respond with a 9 or 10 are labeled as “promoters”, or loyal enthusiasts, while guests who respond with a score of 0 to 6 are “detractors”, or unhappy customers. Those who leave a 7 or 8 are considered to be “passives”. Our company’s NPS (Net Promoter Score) is then calculated by subtracting the percent of “detractors” from the percent of “promoters”, and is a number that ranges from -100 (worst case scenario: all responses are detractors) to +100 (best case scenario: all responses are promoters).</p>\n<p>By measuring customer loyalty as opposed to satisfaction with a single stay, NPS surveys aim to be a more effective methodology to determine the likelihood that the customer will return to book again, spread the word to their friends, and resist market pressure to defect to a competitor. In this blog post, we look to our data to find out if this is actually the case. We find that higher NPS does in general correspond to more referrals and rebookings. But we find that controlling for other factors, it does not significantly improve our ability to predict if a guest will book on Airbnb again in the next year. Therefore, the business impact of increasing NPS scores may be less than what we would estimate from a naive analysis.</p>\n<h3>Methodology</h3>\n<p>We will refer to a single person’s response to the NPS question as their LTR (likelihood to recommend) score. While NPS ranges from -100 to +100, LTR is an integer that ranges from 0 to 10. In this study, we look at all guests with trips that ended between January 15, 2014 and April 1, 2014. If a guest took more than one trip within that time frame, only the first trip is considered. We then try to predict if the guest will make another booking with Airbnb, up to one year after the end of the first trip.</p>\n<p>One thing to note is that leaving a review after a trip is optional, as are the various components of the review itself. A small fraction of guests do not leave a review or leave a review but choose not to respond to the NPS question. While NPS is typically calculated only from responders, in this analysis we include non-responders by factoring in both guests who do not a leave a review as well as those who leave a review but choose not to answer the NPS question.</p>\n<p>To assess the predictive power of LTR, we control for other parameters that are correlated with rebooking. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Overall review score and responses to review subcategories. All review categories are on a scale of 1-5.</li>\n<li>Guest acquisition channel (e.g. organic or through marketing campaigns)</li>\n<li>Trip destination (e.g. America, Europe, Asia, etc)</li>\n<li>Origin of guest</li>\n<li>Previous bookings by the guest on Airbnb</li>\n<li>Trip Length</li>\n<li>Number of guests</li>\n<li>Price per night</li>\n<li>Month of checkout (to account for seasonality)</li>\n<li>Room type (entire home, private room, shared room)</li>\n<li>Number of other listings the host owns</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We acknowledge that our approach may have the following shortcomings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There may be other forms of loyalty not captured by rebooking. While we do look at referrals submitted through our company’s referral program, customer loyalty can also be manifested through word of mouth of referrals that are not captured in this study.</li>\n<li>There may be a longer time horizon for some guests to rebook. We look one year out, but some guests may travel less frequently and would rebook in two to three years.</li>\n<li>One guest’s LTR may not be a direct substitute for the aggregate NPS. It is possible that even if we cannot accurately predict one customer’s likelihood to rebook based on their LTR, we would fare better if we used NPS to predict an entire cohort’s likelihood to rebook.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Despite these shortcomings, we hope that this study will provide a data informed way to think about the value NPS brings to our understanding of the offline experience.</p>\n<h3>Descriptive Stats of the Data</h3>\n<p>Our data covers more than 600,000 guests. Our data shows that out of guests who submitted a review, two-thirds of guests were NPS promoters. &nbsp;More than half gave an LTR of 10. Of the 600,000 guests in our data set, only 2% were detractors.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://nerds.airbnb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/photo2.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-176595363\" alt=\"photo2\" src=\"http://nerds.airbnb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/photo2.png\" width=\"622\" height=\"356\"></a></p>\n<p>While the overall review score for a trip is aimed at assessing the quality of the trip, the NPS question serves to gauge customer loyalty. We look at how correlated these two variables are by looking at the distributions of LTR scores broken down by overall review score. Although the LTR and overall review rating are correlated, they do provide some differences in information. For example, of the small number of guests who had a disappointing experience and left a 1-star review, 26% were actually promoters of Airbnb, indicating that they were still very positive about the company.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://nerds.airbnb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/photo3.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-176595362\" alt=\"photo3\" src=\"http://nerds.airbnb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/photo3.png\" width=\"624\" height=\"623\"></a></p>\n<p>Keeping in mind that a very small fraction of our travelers are NPS detractors and that LTR is heavily correlated to the overall review score, we investigate how LTR correlates to rebooking rates and referral rates.</p>\n<p>We count a guest as a referrer if they referred at least one friend via our referral system in the 12 months after trip end. We see that out of guests who responded to the NPS question, higher LTR corresponds to a higher rebook rate and a higher referral rate.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://nerds.airbnb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/photo4.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-176595361\" alt=\"photo4\" src=\"http://nerds.airbnb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/photo4.png\" width=\"623\" height=\"313\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://nerds.airbnb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/photo5.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-176595360\" alt=\"photo5\" src=\"http://nerds.airbnb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/photo5.png\" width=\"621\" height=\"313\"></a></p>\n<p>Without controlling for other variables, someone with a LTR of 10 is 13% more likely to rebook and 4% more likely to submit a referral in the next 12 months than someone who is a detractor (0-6). Interestingly, we note that the increase in rebooking rates for responders is nearly linear with LTR (we did not have enough data to differentiate between people who gave responses between 0-6). These results imply that for Airbnb, collapsing people who respond with a 9 versus a 10 into one “promoter” bucket results in loss of information. We also note that guests who did not leave a review behave the same as detractors. In fact, they are slightly less likely to rebook and submit a referral than guests with LTR of 0-6. However, guests who submitted a review but did not answer the NPS question (labeled as “no_nps”) behave similar to promoters. These results indicate that when measuring NPS, it is important to keep track of response rate as well.</p>\n<p>Next, we look at how other factors might influence rebooking rates. For instance, we find just from our 10 weeks of data that rebooking rates are seasonal. This is likely because more off season travelers tend to be loyal customers and frequent travelers.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://nerds.airbnb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/photo6.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-176595359\" alt=\"photo6\" src=\"http://nerds.airbnb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/photo6.png\" width=\"624\" height=\"306\"></a></p>\n<p>We see that guests who had shorter trips are more likely to rebook. This could be because some guests will use Airbnb mostly for longer stays and they just aren’t as likely to take another one of those in the next year.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://nerds.airbnb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/photo7.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-176595358\" alt=\"photo7\" src=\"http://nerds.airbnb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/photo7.png\" width=\"621\" height=\"355\"></a></p>\n<p>We also see that the rebooking rate has kind of a parabolic relationship to the price per night of the listing. Guests who stayed in very expensive listings are less likely to rebook, but guests who stayed in very cheap listings are also unlikely to rebook.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://nerds.airbnb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/photo8.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-176595357\" alt=\"photo8\" src=\"http://nerds.airbnb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/photo8.png\" width=\"621\" height=\"366\"></a></p>\n<h3>Which review categories are most predictive of rebooking?</h3>\n<p>In addition to the Overall star rating and the LTR score, guests can choose to respond to the following subcategories in their review, all of which are on a 1-5 scale:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Accuracy</li>\n<li>Cleanliness</li>\n<li>Checkin</li>\n<li>Communication</li>\n<li>Location</li>\n<li>Value</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this section we will investigate the power of review ratings to predict whether or not a guest will take another trip on Airbnb in the 12 months after trip end. We will also study which subcategories are most predictive of rebooking.</p>\n<p>To do this, we compare a series of nested logistic regression models. We start off with a base model, whose dependent variables include only the non-review characteristics of the trip that we mentioned in the above section:</p>\n<pre>f0 = 'rebooked ~ dim_user_acq_channel + n_guests + nights + I_(price_per_night*10) + I((price_per_night*10)^2) + guest_region + host_region + room_type + n_host_listings + first_time_guest + checkout_month</pre>\n<p>Then, we build a series of models adding one of the review categories to this base model:</p>\n<pre>f1 = f0 + communication\nf2 = f0 + cleanliness\nf3 = f0 + checkin\nf4 = f0 + accuracy\nf5 = f0 + value\nf6 = f0 + location\nf7 = f0 + overall_score\nf8 = f0 + ltr_score</pre>\n<p>We compare the quality of each of the models `f1` to `f8` against that of the nested model `f0` by comparing the Akaike information criterion (AIC) of the fits. AIC trades off between the goodness of the fit of the model and the number of parameters, thus discouraging overfitting.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://nerds.airbnb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/photo9.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-176595356\" alt=\"photo9\" src=\"http://nerds.airbnb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/photo9.png\" width=\"622\" height=\"312\"></a></p>\n<p>If we were just to include one review category, LTR and overall score are pretty much tied for first place. Adding any one of the subcategories also improves the model, but not as much as we were to include overall score or LTR.</p>\n<p>Next, we adjust our base model to include LTR and repeat the process to see what is the second review category we could add.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://nerds.airbnb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/photo10.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-176595355\" alt=\"photo10\" src=\"http://nerds.airbnb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/photo10.png\" width=\"623\" height=\"311\"></a></p>\n<p>Given LTR, the next subcategory that will improve our model the most is the overall review score. Adding a second review category to the model only marginally improves the fit of the model (note the difference is scale of the two graphs).</p>\n<p>We repeat this process, incrementally adding review categories to the model until the models are not statistically significant anymore. We are left with the following set of review categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>LTR</li>\n<li>Overall score</li>\n<li>Any three of the six subcategories</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These findings show that because the review categories are strongly correlated with one another, once we have the LTR and the overall score, we only need three of the six subcategories to optimize our model. Adding more subcategories will add more degrees of freedom without significantly improving the predictive accuracy of the model.</p>\n<p>Finally we tested the predictive accuracies of our models:</p>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"295\">\n<col width=\"107\">\n<col width=\"221\"></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;Categories</td>\n<td>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Accuracy</p>\n</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">LTR Only</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">55.997%</p>\n</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Trip Info Only</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">63.495%</p>\n</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Trip info + LTR</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">63.58%</p>\n</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Trip info + Other review categories</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">63.593%</p>\n</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Trip Info + LTR + Other review categories</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">63.595%</p>\n</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Using only a guest’s LTR at the end of trip, we can accurately predict if they will rebook again in the next 12 months 56% of the time. Given just basic information we know about the guest, host and trip, we improve this predictive accuracy to 63.5%. Adding review categories (not including LTR), we add an additional &nbsp;0.1% improvement. Given all this, adding LTR to the model only improves the predictive accuracy by another 0.002%.</p>\n<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n</div>\n<p>Post trip reviews (including LTR) only marginally improves our ability to predict whether or not a guest rebooks 12 months after checkout. Controlling for trip and guest characteristics, review star ratings only improve our predictive accuracy by ~0.1%. Out of all the review subcategories, LTR is the most useful in predicting rebooking, but it only adds 0.002% increase in predictive accuracy if we control for other review categories. This is because LTR and review scores are highly correlated.</p>\n<p>Reviews serve purposes other than to predict rebooking. They enable trust in the platform, help hosts build their reputation, and can also be used for host quality enforcement. We found that guests with higher LTR are more likely to refer someone through our referral program. They could also be more likely to refer through word of mouth. Detractors could actually detract potential people from joining the platform. These additional ways in which NPS could be connected to business performance are not explored here. But given the extremely low number of detractors and passives and the marginal power post trip LTR has in predicting rebooking, we should be cautious putting excessive weight on guest NPS.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://nerds.airbnb.com/nps-rebooking/\">How well does NPS predict rebooking?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://nerds.airbnb.com\">Airbnb Engineering</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"yarpp-related-rss\">\n<h3></h3>\n<div class=\"yarpp-thumbnails-horizontal\">\n<a class=\"yarpp-thumbnail\" href=\"http://nerds.airbnb.com/host-preferences/\" title=\"How Airbnb uses machine learning to detect host preferences\">\n<img width=\"120\" height=\"120\" src=\"http://nerds.airbnb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/harlem-120x120.jpg\" class=\"attachment-yarpp-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"harlem\"><span class=\"yarpp-thumbnail-title\">How Airbnb uses machine learning to detect host preferences</span></a>\n<a class=\"yarpp-thumbnail\" href=\"http://nerds.airbnb.com/scaling-data-science/\" title=\"At Airbnb, Data Science Belongs Everywhere: Insights from Five Years of Hypergrowth\">\n<img width=\"120\" height=\"120\" src=\"http://nerds.airbnb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-07-at-10.16.52-AM-120x120.png\" class=\"attachment-yarpp-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"data-science\"><span class=\"yarpp-thumbnail-title\">At Airbnb, Data Science Belongs Everywhere: Insights from Five Years of Hypergrowth</span></a>\n<a class=\"yarpp-thumbnail\" href=\"http://nerds.airbnb.com/confidence-splitting-criterions/\" title=\"Confidence Splitting Criterions Can Improve Precision And Recall in Random Forest Classifiers\">\n<img width=\"120\" height=\"120\" src=\"http://nerds.airbnb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/conf-120x120.jpg\" class=\"attachment-yarpp-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"conf\"><span class=\"yarpp-thumbnail-title\">Confidence Splitting Criterions Can Improve Precision And Recall in Random Forest Classifiers</span></a>\n</div>\n</div>",

For example, the team developed data feeds that would provide warnings about impending local floods or hurricanes in relevant search results for Google users.   </p>\n<p>Scott said Airbnb started a Disaster Response Tool three years ago in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. “We were inspired by a host (in the area where the storm hit) who started opening up her home to people who had been displaced. We wanted to build something to support what she was doing and enable the rest of our host community to participate as well.”</p>\n<p>Scott: “The Disaster Response Tool was built as a side project. But now we can activate the tool within minutes for a specific location or area that has been hit by a natural disaster. Hosts can list their space for free and we wave all of our fees and create a way for displaced people in that area to find a place to stay.”</p>\n<p>Garey: “Watsi is entirely a social impact organization. We let people directly fund healthcare for people all around the world, and 100 percent of donations go to the patient. Technology seemed to be the answer we needed to focus on. We saw people using technology like Airbnb to bust open narrow channels to allow person-to-person interaction and create new ways to solve a problem. So we decided to do the same thing to tackle healthcare in a new way.”</p>\n<p>How technology can make a difference (16:13)</p>\n<p>Scott: “In the case of a natural disaster, people don’t always have reliable Internet access, or they might not have much battery left on their phone. So we’ve been thinking about how those people can use Airbnb when they are facing technical limitations.”</p>\n<p>Helping people in disaster-hit areas may require “using old technology” rather than the latest tech, Scott continued. For example, SMS messaging often continues to work after a disaster when phone calls, email and online access can be difficult, so Airbnb has been exploring ways for users to book or accept reservations through SMS. </p>\n<p>Romano: “We’re working on an initiative at Google.org to see how technology can help people with disabilities live more independently. What if we could recognize and translate sign language? What if we could analyze content in video and provide natural language descriptions of it?” Another area of investigation is mobility, in which “eye trackers connect to a communication device, so you can communicate with the world by typing with your eyes.”</p>\n<p>How engineers can contribute to social change (20:46)</p>\n<p>Scott: “We have a woman user in Florence who donates 50 percent of her Airbnb earnings to a community art project. Another user donates 10 percent of his earnings, and he and his guest decide together which local organization to contribute to. So my advice is to look at how your users are already helping other people with your product, then figure out how to scale it and open it up to your whole community.”</p>\n<p>Romano recommended marrying your passion for technology with social issues you care about, because the two are “an amazing combination.” Find others with shared passions by asking around. “Talk to people about what they’re working on and tell them what you’re interested in.”</p>\n<p>Romano added that “it’s really hard when you’re trying to prioritize and focus to create space and resources to work on (social impact projects). What works is when people just start doing things (for social impact) without asking for permission. You get other passionate people together and come up with a proof of concept and you can start seeing how it could be better if you had a product manager, user experience person, and multiple engineers working on it.” </p>\n<p>Garey added that in 10 to 15 years, the areas of engineering and social change will blur. “So don’t feel like you have to make a choice between working at a company with a product that’s creating value and making a lot of money vs. doing something that’s good for the world. You can do well and do good at the same time.”</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://nerds.airbnb.com/impacting-social-change/\">How Technology and Engineers Can Impact Social Change</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://nerds.airbnb.com\">Airbnb Engineering</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"yarpp-related-rss yarpp-related-none\">\n<h3></h3>\n</div>",

The company&rsquo;s tech stack includes the PHP Framework&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;among others. Hitherto now, I&rsquo;ve used (<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">and still use</em>) Laravel to build some awesome apps.</p><p name=\"13a0\" id=\"13a0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Laravel has a great logging system that is simple and elegant. Furthermore, there&rsquo;s a <a href=\"https://github.com/rap2hpoutre/laravel-log-viewer\" data-href=\"https://github.com/rap2hpoutre/laravel-log-viewer\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">library</a> for showing the logs in the browser. Being able to read the logs in the browser is good for application debugging and insight. Especially in a production environment.</p><p name=\"2248\" id=\"2248\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">So here I am in the world of CodeIgniter and couldn&rsquo;t find an equivalent library to read my logs for debugging and insight.</p><p name=\"5c45\" id=\"5c45\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">So I took up the challenge and created my first Open Source project of the year&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;<a href=\"https://github.com/SeunMatt/codeigniter-log-viewer\" data-href=\"https://github.com/SeunMatt/codeigniter-log-viewer\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">codeigniter-log-viewer</a>.</p><h3 name=\"5dfa\" id=\"5dfa\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Usage</h3><p name=\"4c1d\" id=\"4c1d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">First, let&rsquo;s add it to a dependency. We can do that by executing:</p><pre name=\"cebe\" id=\"cebe\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\">composer require seunmatt/codeigniter-log-viewer</pre><p name=\"cbc2\" id=\"cbc2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">Then, we can create a CodeIgniter application controller, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">LogViewerController.php</em>:</p><pre name=\"6ac3\" id=\"6ac3\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\">private $logViewer;</pre><pre name=\"eb44\" id=\"eb44\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\">public function __construct() {<br/>    $this->logViewer = new \\CILogViewer\\CILogViewer();<br/>    //...<br/>}</pre><pre name=\"6a38\" id=\"6a38\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\">public function index() {<br/>    echo $this->logViewer->showLogs();<br/>    return;<br/>}</pre><p name=\"41fd\" id=\"41fd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">What we did is to instantiate <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">$logViewer</em> in the constructor and then echo the result of <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">showLogs()</em> in the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">index()</em> function.</p><p name=\"3e25\" id=\"3e25\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">showLogs()</em> method of <a href=\"https://github.com/SeunMatt/codeigniter-log-viewer\" data-href=\"https://github.com/SeunMatt/codeigniter-log-viewer\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">codeigniter-log-viewer</a> will parse the content of the log files in <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">application/logs</em>&nbsp;<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">. </em>It will return it for display on the browser.</p><p name=\"e37a\" id=\"e37a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Finally, we can map any route of our choice to the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">index()</em> we created above. This can be done by adding an entry to the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">$route</em> array in <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">application/config/routes.php:</em></p><pre name=\"f5f9\" id=\"f5f9\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\">$route['logs'] = \"logViewerController/index\";</pre><p name=\"9360\" id=\"9360\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">Now we can visit <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">/logs</em> on the browser and see all the log files there. It&rsquo;s also possible to delete and download the log files.</p><p name=\"f81f\" id=\"f81f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Note</strong>: It is advisable to use a protected route in production environment to avoid general public access.</p><h3 name=\"b348\" id=\"b348\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">How it&nbsp;works</h3><p name=\"f377\" id=\"f377\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Internally, the library read the name of all the log files that are available in the default logs directory into an array and reverse it. If no file is specified in the URL query parameters, the latest log file is processed for display by default.</p><p name=\"95fb\" id=\"95fb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Processing of a log file for display involves reading its contents, using regex to determine the log level and the CSS class and icon of each entry.</p><p name=\"97d4\" id=\"97d4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Each entry is also checked to know if it&rsquo;s a new log line or a continuation of the previous line (<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">due to a newline character</em>).</p><p name=\"23e7\" id=\"23e7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Finally, the log entries are processed into HTML content that is then sent to the browser for display.</p><p name=\"099c\" id=\"099c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The complete source code is available on Github if you want to play around with it or/and adapt it for use in other frameworks.</p><h3 name=\"09b0\" id=\"09b0\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h3-strong\">Conclusion</strong></h3><p name=\"235a\" id=\"235a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Now it&rsquo;s easier and faster to debug CodeIgniter application&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;even in production. Spread the word around to friends and colleagues at work.</p><p name=\"258d\" id=\"258d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I want to hear about your experience (<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">and opinions</em>) of using the library in the comment section.

It&rsquo;s a project to help coders do one of four things: start coding, code more, blog more, or get a job.</p><p name=\"c7d2\" id=\"c7d2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">You pick a challenge, and over the course of 5, 7, or 9 weeks, you get a weekly mission with reading, research, and a homework assignment to help you reach your goal. It&rsquo;s based on powerful questions, guided research, and curated resources to help point you in the right direction. <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2DISkLU\" data-href=\"http://bit.ly/2DISkLU\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">You can learn more and sign up here (first mission is released Jan 22, so sign up by then)</a>.</p><p name=\"0fca\" id=\"0fca\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This challenge is based on a very simple premise: when you&rsquo;re learning to code, there is not one universal roadmap. It&rsquo;s frustrating, but it&rsquo;s the truth.</p><h4 name=\"fc91\" id=\"fc91\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">How I came up with&nbsp;#CNC2018</h4><figure name=\"2ea0\" id=\"2ea0\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--h4\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 467px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 66.60000000000001%;\"></div><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*RVYEyYPiu9ugXdGr2RhkeA.jpeg\" data-width=\"1400\" data-height=\"933\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*RVYEyYPiu9ugXdGr2RhkeA.jpeg\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*RVYEyYPiu9ugXdGr2RhkeA.jpeg\"/></div></figure><p name=\"d813\" id=\"d813\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">I sipped my cranberry juice as she raised her hand. She sat in the middle of the mostly empty room, and waited patiently to be noticed. They called on her, and she stood up to ask the infamous question, &ldquo;How do I start learning to code?&rdquo;</p><p name=\"35ec\" id=\"35ec\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">All the panelists turned to me, and my chest tightened. Of the four of us, I was the &ldquo;new coder expert,&rdquo; so I put my drink down and reluctantly pulled the mic to me.</p><p name=\"4c0e\" id=\"4c0e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I get this question often. I&rsquo;m usually excited to answer it. But today, I worried I would disappoint her.</p><p name=\"0d3d\" id=\"0d3d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It&rsquo;s a deceptively difficult question to answer. It assumes, first and foremost, that there <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">is</em> an answer; a single, uncontested, logical answer. It focuses so much on the &ldquo;start learning to code&rdquo; and less on the &ldquo;I&rdquo;, but the &ldquo;I&rdquo; is the most important part.</p><p name=\"ce1e\" id=\"ce1e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I used to give juicy, satisfying answers: Start with Ruby, it&rsquo;s the world&rsquo;s friendliest language! Try JavaScript, the language of the web! Use Codecademy to give you a little taste, it&rsquo;s free and you can start today!</p><p name=\"df9a\" id=\"df9a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">When I was feeling more resource-oriented, I went to my bag of websites and pulled a few out. Treehouse is great for videos and courses. FreeCodeCamp is a great community and learning resource for JavaScript. Check out Coursera for more computer science-y options. And you can&rsquo;t forget about good old fashioned YouTube! Search for a language or framework and pick a short video to get you started!</p><p name=\"95b8\" id=\"95b8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">They took furious notes as I spoke, proving that what I said was valuable and correct. But it wasn&rsquo;t.</p><p name=\"8979\" id=\"8979\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">There are many ways to start coding. There are many things to learn and resources to pick from. In the overwhelming plethora of options, we search for a roadmap. What is the single set of successive steps I can take to get to this particular destination?</p><p name=\"0ace\" id=\"0ace\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But in the hundreds of conversations I&rsquo;ve had with coding hopefuls, I&rsquo;ve learned that the &ldquo;I&rdquo; in &ldquo;How do I learn to start learning to code&rdquo; dictates any such roadmap, and that each roadmap is personal and unique.</p><p name=\"f4fd\" id=\"f4fd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Why am I learning to code? If you&rsquo;re learning specifically to get a job, your roadmap will be very different than if you&rsquo;re just learning for fun. Now, we have to think about what kind of job you&rsquo;re hoping for, how much money you want to make, where that job even is (are you willing to move, or should we focus on the local market?), and is there a deadline of when you need to get this new job? So many questions.</p><p name=\"7a01\" id=\"7a01\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Let&rsquo;s look at time and money. How much of each can I invest in this learning? If I don&rsquo;t have a lot of money (and how much do I consider to be &ldquo;a lot of money&rdquo;?), that eliminates a subsection of learn-to-code options. If I don&rsquo;t have a lot of time, what&rsquo;s something I can learn that&rsquo;s easy to pick up and doesn&rsquo;t require a huge a time commitment to get started? What am I sacrificing for that ease? So many more questions.</p><p name=\"fb23\" id=\"fb23\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Next, let&rsquo;s inspect community. Do I have people in my life who can serve as tutors, teachers, possibly mentors? Do I live in a place where I can get in-person support, or will that support primarily be online? Does it matter? If I&rsquo;m doing this all by myself, finding an in-person course might make the journey easier. If I have developers in my life, I can reach out to them to course correct and guide me, making my journey a bit more efficient. Questions galore.</p><p name=\"58f1\" id=\"58f1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">All of these questions are so important, and they&rsquo;re all about you. So I held the mic and took a big breath and told this woman exactly that. It would&rsquo;ve been nice to give her a roadmap, a three-step magic trick to get to where she wanted to go. But there just isn&rsquo;t one.</p><p name=\"3662\" id=\"3662\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I paused when I finished, looked at her then around the room to see how this answer would be received. I braced myself for disappointment. The other panelists nodded, the room smiled, the woman seemed genuinely appreciative. Surprised, but reflective. I sighed with relief and took a sip of my juice.</p><p name=\"af8b\" id=\"af8b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">That&rsquo;s been my go-to answer ever since, and I can feel how much more helpful it is. The problem is that getting the most value from that answer usually involves a conversation, a back and forth to explore and dissect. I&rsquo;ve been thinking of ways to scale this. How do you scale the answer to such a personal question, when there are so many things to consider, and no single, right answer? You create the <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2DISkLU\" data-href=\"http://bit.ly/2DISkLU\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CodeNewbie Challenge</a>.</p><p name=\"e3b5\" id=\"e3b5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Over time, #CNC2018 helps you create and iterate on your personal roadmap, your own curriculum, based on your needs and lifestyle. And like most adventures, it&rsquo;s much easier to do with friends. So we&rsquo;ve created a closed Facebook group so can you share your wins, your lessons, and your story with others.</p><p name=\"b3ac\" id=\"b3ac\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">I&rsquo;m so excited to finally launch it. It&rsquo;s a brand new year, the perfect time to take on a new challenge. So join <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2DISkLU\" data-href=\"http://bit.ly/2DISkLU\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#CNC2018</a> and sign up by Jan 22. I&rsquo;m excited to see where your roadmap takes you.</p></div></div></section></div>"

        "title": "The Importance of Offsite Backups",
        "description": "<h3 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h3><p>Data has become some of the most valuable and irreplaceable assets for both individuals and businesses alike. Whether it consists of vacation photos, last year&rsquo;s sales reports, or top-secret corporate strategy plans, the last thing you want is for your data to be lost or to fall into the wrong hands. </p><p>Backing up important files using an auxiliary storage device has become an everyday data protection practice, but this is not by itself a sure-fire solution. After all, backup media have the same risk of being damaged or stolen if they&rsquo;re stored in the same place as the data&rsquo;s source. In order to add an extra layer of protection to their valuable information, many people and companies choose to store their backups at an offsite venue to improve their odds against data loss.</p><p>In this article, we&rsquo;ll go over some of the history and technology behind offsite data backups, as well as some practical matters to consider when remotely backing up your own data.</p><h2 id=\"a-bit-about-auxiliary-storage\">A Bit About Auxiliary Storage</h2><p>The history of auxiliary storage can be traced to the use of punched paper cards as a means of recording and storing information. Punch cards were invented in France in the early 18th century as a way to control patterns in a textile loom, and through the 1800s they were adapted into other uses ranging from calculating numbers to controlling player pianos. However, these initial use cases were solely used to instruct machinery and otherwise did not store data. </p><p>This changed in 1890 as a result of the United States census. The country&rsquo;s rapidly growing population and new requirements for more detailed population information meant that the Census Bureau needed to drastically improve its efficiency so as to process the census data in a timely fashion. This need led Herman Hollerith, then an employee of the Census Bureau, to develop the Hollerith Electric Tabulating System which used punched cards to tabulate and store population data.</p><p>Hollerith&rsquo;s punch card machines soon became the industry standard for data storage. His company would eventually be merged into the conglomerate that would form International Business Machines, Inc. &mdash; better known today as IBM &mdash; which would continue to produce punch cards into the 1970s. But as businesses and governments&rsquo; data storage needs grew, punched paper cards became severely limiting in terms of how much data they could hold and how quickly they could be read by machines. </p><p>Technology marched forward, though, and each successive generation of auxiliary storage media &mdash; from magnetic tape, to hard drives, floppy disks, and optical disks &mdash; brought an ever-increasing areal density (the quantity of information bits that can be stored in a given unit of physical space on computer storage media) while simultaneously reducing the cost-per-megabyte of storable data. They also enabled faster read and write speeds, making it easier for people and organizations to store and retrieve their data.</p><h2 id=\"moving-data-offsite\">Moving Data Offsite</h2><p>The need to have backup copies of crucial data has been clear for as long as people have been keeping important records. Because originals could be lost or damaged in an accident, and malicious actors were likely to target valuable information for theft, the urgency to not just backup data but also keep that data secure was only underscored. This led many people and organizations over the years to protect their data at offsite storage facilities. However, storing backup data at an outside location brought a number of logistical challenges.</p><p>Before the ubiquity of software that can quickly transfer files over the internet, an organization&rsquo;s only option for offsite storage involved physically moving auxiliary storage devices. Reels of magnetic tape or stacks of hard drives would need to be picked up from the central location and delivered to the storage vault by car, which could turn out to be extremely costly for institutions producing a great deal of data backups. </p><p>Because storage media deteriorates over time, it was important for companies building storage facilities to be aware of the physical limitations of data stores. Magnetic tape has an estimated shelf life of about 10 years, floppy disks have around 10 to 20, and older types of optical media can only be expected to last about about 5 to 10. This degradation meant that older storage devices would need to be regularly cycled out and replaced with new ones to prevent data loss. Regardless of what storage format is used, data backups have always been vulnerable to physical damage, particularly from fire, smoke, water, excessive heat, natural disaster, and even dust. Therefore, privately managed storage facilities would also have had to be built with controls against these environmental factors in place.</p><p>Finally, there was the ever-present issue of keeping data secure. Computer data encryption didn&rsquo;t see broad implementation until the late 1970s, and even then it was primarily the tool of only the largest corporations and governments. This meant that, for the most part, your data&rsquo;s security was only as strong as the lock on your door.</p><p>Altogether, this put a sizable burden of responsibility on the part of companies and institutions who would store their backups at their own offsite location. It wasn&rsquo;t until the late 1980s that public cloud remote backup services began to appear. This was largely due to the fact that, until that time, modem speeds were too slow for internet data transfer to be practical. However, almost all of the remote backup services at this time were only focused on enterprise-level customers, leaving consumers and small businesses with few options for where to store offsite data backups. </p><h2 id=\"backup-alternatives-in-the-cloud\">Backup Alternatives in the Cloud</h2><p>With the rise of cloud computing in the mid-2000&rsquo;s, along with an ample spike in the amount of data created by organizations and individuals, cloud-based data storage has become a convenient and affordable solution. Services like Crashplan or Backblaze are online backup services focused on business clients. Likewise, the rise of file hosting services like Dropbox has brought consumers the ability to backup their data remotely as well. </p><p>Although public cloud storage solutions like these do resolve many of the issues generated by previous methods of offsite data backups, there are still several risks associated with them. For example, remote data centers are at just as much risk of natural disasters as anywhere else. Of course, any reputable cloud storage provider is going to take steps to mitigate these particular risks with fire- and flood-resistant building materials and contingency plans for power outages. Also, like any other kind of company, a remote backup service could be sold, close down, or change its services, potentially leaving clients in a difficult place as they seek out alternatives.</p><p>Despite this, remote backup solutions still offer many desirable features. For example, they take care of all the logistics that go into managing a data vault, and their user-friendly interfaces lower the cost of training employees on how to use the service. Because these companies specialize in data backups and storage, they are usually better equipped to adapt to new technologies and innovative solutions than a company managing its own offsite data storage. Also, most cloud storage companies have redundancy built into their infrastructure to prevent outages or data loss, helping to ensure high availability of their customers&rsquo; data (although it never hurts to duplicate backups yourself, just in case).</p><p>All of this means that remote backup services are typically cheaper and easier than a completely self-managed offsite solution, but it&rsquo;s important to research each one&rsquo;s options and features before signing up for any remote backup service. </p><h2 id=\"object-storage-as-a-backups-solution\">Object Storage as a Backups Solution</h2><p>In recent years, object storage solutions such as <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/products/object-storage/\">DigitalOcean Spaces</a> have become popular alternatives to traditional offsite backup services. While public cloud backup services are popular for their simplicity and easy implementation, object storage services offer a level of flexibility that could be better suited for some companies&rsquo; storage needs.</p><p>Thanks to the design of the object storage model, object storage services can allow users to store very large amounts of data at a lower cost when compared to remote backup or file-sharing services. This makes them highly scalable, which is appealing to companies that are positioning themselves for future growth. Also, because of features like replication and erasure coding, object storage makes it easy to duplicate data, bringing another layer of protection against data loss and ensuring high availability.</p><p>Object storage isn&rsquo;t always a perfect solution, especially if a user needs to make frequent changes to their data and perform lots of random data access. However, if you&rsquo;re in need of relatively static archival storage, object storage services are a convenient, elegant, and highly affordable solution for securely storing your company&rsquo;s key information.</p><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>By now, it&rsquo;s fairly common knowledge that performing regular backups is an important data security practice, but even small businesses and consumers are beginning to realize the value of storing their backups at an offsite location. After all, it only takes one stroke of bad luck and everything from family photos to corporate financials could be gone in an instant.</p><p>It has been a long road from the days of shipping cartons of punch cards to an off-site archive to the development of today&rsquo;s cloud storage solutions. However, thanks to advances in technology and new paradigms like cloud-based backups and object storage services, both businesses and individuals now have the ability to securely backup their data at a remote location almost instantly.</p><p>For more information on storage and backups solutions, the following tutorials may be of interest:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-digitalocean-spaces\">Introduction to DigitalOcean Spaces</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-choose-an-effective-backup-strategy-for-your-vps\">How To Choose an Effective Backup Strategy for your VPS</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/object-storage-vs-block-storage-services\">Object Storage vs. Block Storage Services</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-back-up-a-synology-nas-to-digitalocean-spaces\">How To Back Up a Synology NAS to DigitalOcean Spaces</a></li></ul>"

It was gut-wrenching. I&rsquo;ve fired people before&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;but it doesn&rsquo;t matter how many times you do it, it always feels downright terrible.</p><p name=\"49bc\" id=\"49bc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">To prepare for the difficult conversation, I asked a few mentors for advice. I also posed the question to <a href=\"https://thewatercooler.io\" data-href=\"https://thewatercooler.io\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Watercooler</a>, our community of leaders from all over the world, to learn how others handle letting someone go.</p><p name=\"fa88\" id=\"fa88\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">From almost 500 CEOs, managers, and executives, I compiled six recommendations on how to handle firing someone with dignity, grace and respect that I thought I&rsquo;d share with you here:</p><h4 name=\"6a45\" id=\"6a45\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Privacy, please.</h4><p name=\"1d8e\" id=\"1d8e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Choose a conference room that&rsquo;s away from the team, ideally that&rsquo;s close to the exits. Or, if you&rsquo;re a remote team, make sure you&rsquo;re in a place that&rsquo;s private when you make your Skype or Google Hangout call. Make sure your phone is turned off and door is closed so you&rsquo;re not interrupted. And never <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">ever</em> do it in a public place, like a coffee shop.</p><h4 name=\"ca35\" id=\"ca35\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">The &ldquo;optimal&rdquo; time doesn&rsquo;t&nbsp;exist.</h4><p name=\"d650\" id=\"d650\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Everyone has different opinions about whether you should let someone go on Friday end-of-day, or earlier in the week&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;but really, it&rsquo;s moot. Once the decision has been made, it&rsquo;s best to let the person go as fast as possible. There never is an &ldquo;optimal&rdquo; time to fire someone. Don&rsquo;t let time or day or day of week become an excuse to delay. The longer you wait, the more your interactions with that person become disingenuous and uncomfortable in the days and hours leading up to you telling them they&rsquo;re being let go.</p><h4 name=\"20f3\" id=\"20f3\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Cut to the&nbsp;chase.</h4><p name=\"7ac0\" id=\"7ac0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Don&rsquo;t dawdle or make small talk. Your opening sentence should be delivered in 5 seconds or less. For example, one Watercooler member suggested you say, &ldquo;Claire, I&rsquo;m letting you go effective immediately.&rdquo; Be clear, succinct, and direct. Nothing you can say will soften the blow so don&rsquo;t try to sugar coat your message or ask about how a project is going, etc.</p><h4 name=\"679e\" id=\"679e\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">It&rsquo;s a decision, not a conversation.</h4><p name=\"4d27\" id=\"4d27\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Don&rsquo;t get drawn into an extensive conversation or argument&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;it&rsquo;s a decision that&rsquo;s been made, not something that&rsquo;s up for debate. Make that clear. One Watercooler member suggested that after stating that you&rsquo;re letting this person go, your second sentence should articulate terms (severance, impact to equity, etc), and your third sentence should indicate this is non-negotiable. Listen to their reaction, answer questions as you see fit, but try not to get pulled into defending your decision for hours on end.</p><h4 name=\"cf01\" id=\"cf01\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">This sucks for you, but sucks way worse for&nbsp;them.</h4><p name=\"fb1b\" id=\"fb1b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Another <a href=\"https://thewatercooler.io\" data-href=\"https://thewatercooler.io\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Watercooler</a> member cautioned that you may be tempted to offer comfort by saying something like, &ldquo;This is a difficult decision&rdquo; or &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t want to do this.&rdquo; But the last thing you want to do is indulge and pontificate on how you&rsquo;re personally feeling. To be frank, the other person doesn&rsquo;t care how difficult the decision was for you&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;you made it, regardless. And, if you really didn&rsquo;t want to do it, you wouldn&rsquo;t have. Of course it sucks for you, but that&rsquo;s not for you to impose on the person you&rsquo;re firing. Find someone else to confide your pain in, and keep in mind that the decision you&rsquo;re making is on behalf of the team, the company, and their best interest.</p><h4 name=\"60ef\" id=\"60ef\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Communicate the decision to your team with&nbsp;grace.</h4><p name=\"303a\" id=\"303a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Ask how the person being let go prefers to break the news to the team. Their preference might be to send a farewell note themselves, or personally tell the team members they are closest with. Other times, they&rsquo;ll ask you to simply relay the news for them. If it&rsquo;s the latter, share the news with respect and mindfulness. Even if the person was fired for performance reasons that were 100% their own fault, thoughtfully consider what is appropriate to disclose. Imagine if the person fired were to overhear you sharing the news with the team: Would they feel it was fair? Use this as a benchmark for how to communicate the decision to your team.</p><p name=\"70d7\" id=\"70d7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">No matter how you do it, letting someone go is one of the hardest things to do as a leader. There truly is no &ldquo;best way&rdquo;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;but hopefully these tips will be helpful should you face this situation in the future.</p><p name=\"a990\" id=\"a990\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">I know it&rsquo;s helped me.</p></div></div></section><section name=\"1e37\" class=\"section section--body\"><div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"/></div><div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p name=\"7f0b\" id=\"7f0b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--leading\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">What&rsquo;s this &ldquo;</em><a href=\"https://thewatercooler.io\" data-href=\"https://thewatercooler.io\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Watercooler</em></a><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">&rdquo; thing I keep mentioning?

Any type, be it primitive or an object, is a valid subject for type coercion. To recall, primitives are: number, string, boolean, null, undefined + Symbol (added in ES6).</p><p name=\"5df6\" id=\"5df6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">As an example of type coercion in practice, look at the <a href=\"https://dorey.github.io/JavaScript-Equality-Table/\" data-href=\"https://dorey.github.io/JavaScript-Equality-Table/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">JavaScript Comparison Table</a>, which shows how the loose equality <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">==</code> operator behaves for different <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">a</code> and <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">b</code> types. This matrix looks scary due to implicit type coercion that <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">==</code> operator does, and it&rsquo;s hardly possible to remember all those combinations. And you don&rsquo;t have to do that&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;just learn the underlying type coercion principles.</p><p name=\"b30c\" id=\"b30c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This article goes in-depth on how type coercion works in JavaScript, and will arm you with the essential knowledge, so you can feel confident explaining what following expressions calculate to. By the end of the article I&rsquo;ll show answers and explain them.</p><pre name=\"cc4b\" id=\"cc4b\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\">true + false<br/>12 / \"6\"<br/>\"number\" + 15 + 3<br/>15 + 3 + \"number\"<br/>[1] > null<br/>\"foo\" + + \"bar\"<br/>'true' == true<br/>false == 'false'<br/>null == ''<br/>!!\"false\" == !!\"true\"<br/>[&lsquo;x&rsquo;] == &lsquo;x&rsquo;<br/>[] + null + 1<br/>[1,2,3] == [1,2,3]<br/>{}+[]+{}+[1]<br/>!+[]+[]+![]<br/>new Date(0) - 0<br/>new Date(0) + 0</pre><p name=\"840f\" id=\"840f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">Yes, this list is full of pretty silly things you can do as a developer. In 90% of use cases it&rsquo;s better to avoid implicit type coercion. Consider this list as a learning exercise to test your knowledge on how type coercion works.

So, keep reading &#128516;</p><h3 name=\"d79a\" id=\"d79a\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Implicit vs. explicit&nbsp;coercion</h3><p name=\"7695\" id=\"7695\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Type coercion can be explicit and implicit.</p><p name=\"260e\" id=\"260e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">When a developer expresses the intention to convert between types by writing the appropriate code, like <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">Number(value)</code>, it&rsquo;s called <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">explicit type coercion</strong> (or type casting).</p><p name=\"26d8\" id=\"26d8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Since JavaScript is a weakly-typed language, values can also be converted between different types automatically, and it is called <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">implicit type coercion</strong>. It usually happens when you apply operators to values of different types, like<br/><code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">1 == null</code>, <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">2/&rsquo;5'</code>, <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">null + new Date()</code>, or it can be triggered by the surrounding context, like with <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">if (value) {&hellip;}</code>, where <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">value</code> is coerced to boolean.</p><p name=\"324e\" id=\"324e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">One operator that does not trigger implicit type coercion is <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">===</code>, which is called the strict equality operator. The loose equality operator <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">==</code> on the other hand does both comparison and type coercion if needed.</p><p name=\"a399\" id=\"a399\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Implicit type coercion is a double edge sword: it&rsquo;s a great source of frustration and defects, but also a useful mechanism that allows us to write less code without losing the readability.</p><h3 name=\"be78\" id=\"be78\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Three types of conversion</h3><p name=\"4e59\" id=\"4e59\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">The first rule to know is there are only three types of conversion in JavaScript:</p><ul class=\"postList\"><li name=\"1ef8\" id=\"1ef8\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">to string</li><li name=\"b0bd\" id=\"b0bd\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">to boolean</li><li name=\"d38b\" id=\"d38b\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">to number</li></ul><p name=\"8f93\" id=\"8f93\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">Secondly, conversion logic for primitives and objects works differently, but both primitives and objects can only be converted in those three ways.</p><p name=\"a1bd\" id=\"a1bd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Let&rsquo;s start with primitives first.</p><h3 name=\"a92e\" id=\"a92e\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">String conversion</h3><p name=\"96c8\" id=\"96c8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">To explicitly convert values to a string apply the <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">String()</code> function.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello everybody,</p><p>for quite a while now I was happy with my editor setup, which consists of <code>spacemacs/haskell-layer</code> and the <code>intero</code> completion-backend. I use <code>stack</code> to build things. This worked well for <code>ghc-8.0.1</code>, and I even managed to transition from <code>lts-8.17</code> to <code>lts-9.11</code> at some point, though I am sure it involved some trying around.</p><p>Alas, I am not able to setup things for <code>lts-10.3</code>. This has come up before in a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/7m8907/what_is_the_preferred_build_system_for_projects/\">recent thread</a> in which <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/BoteboTsebo\">u/BoteboTsebo</a> claims you should just <code>stack install intero</code>, however things apparently aren't as easy.</p><p>Things I tried (probably incomplete and not in order):</p><ul><li>Reinstall the required packages for <a href=\"https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/tree/master/layers/%2Blang/haskell#dependencies\">haskell-layer</a>: <code>stack install apply-refact hlint stylish-haskell hasktags hoogle intero</code></li><li><code>stack install Cabal cabal-install</code></li><li><code>stack setup --update-cabal</code>. This will build a lot of dependencies even after the previous step, so I am not sure how they are related.</li><li>Updated <code>spacemacs</code> and packages used</li></ul><p>All to no avail. After somebody on <code>#haskell</code> notified me of the <a href=\"https://github.com/commercialhaskell/intero/blob/master/TOOLING.md\">TOOLING.md</a> in the <code>intero</code> repository and the fact that you <em>shouldn't</em><code>stack install</code> it, I proceeded to remove it from <code>$HOME/.local/bin</code>.</p><p>Since this didn't work either, as a last measure I deleted all haskell-related binaries from <code>$HOME/.local/bin</code>, deleted <code>$HOME/.stack</code> and reinstalled things while taking care to not <code>stack install intero</code> again.</p><p>It still won't work. Particularly, while editing a Haskell source file I will just get something like</p><pre><code>^[[;1m&lt;no location info>: ^[[;1m^[[31merror:^[[0m^[[0m^[[;1m^[[0m^[[0m^[[;1m not an expression: ... </code></pre><p>at the bottom. Other things like the REPL work. Do note that I could choose to just not use <code>intero</code> for error reporting, for instance by choosing <code>haskell-stack-ghc</code> as the checker used by <code>flycheck</code>. This has the advantage to include <code>hlint</code> suggestions as well, which doesn't work with intero (out of the box?) for me. However, errors reported by GHC are cut off after the first line and so are not of much use.</p><p>Since people claim to be using the <code>spacemacs/intero/stack</code> setup with <code>ghc-8.2.2</code>, how should I proceed? Thanks in advance for any help. If there exists a surefire way of doing this, I think one or the other <code>README.md</code> could be updated as well.</p></div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/mbw_rdt\"> /u/mbw_rdt </a><br/><span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/7r228c/spacemacs_intero_haskelllayer_how_to_transition/\">[link]</a></span><span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/7r228c/spacemacs_intero_haskelllayer_how_to_transition/\">[comments]</a></span>"

Apps built with React and GraphQL are no less candidates for such authentications. </p><p>In this article, we will learn how to add varieties of authentication providers to a GraphQL app using <a href=\"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/scotch_io/~https://www.graph.cool\">Graphcool</a> (GraphQL backend as a service) and <a href=\"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/scotch_io/~https://auth0.com\">Auth0</a> (Authentication as a service). We will also learn how to protect React routes from being accessed if the user fails to be authenticated by our authentication server.</p><p>This tutorial assumes a fair knowledge of GraphQL and React as well as how authentication flow works.

In the same directory where the React project is setup, we can configure a Graphcool server and tell our project how we want our server to behave. Start with installing the <code>create-react-app</code> and <code>graphcool-framework</code> CLI tools:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npm install -g create-react-app graphcool-framework</code></pre><p>Then use the React CLI tool to scaffold a new React app:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\"># scotch-auth is the name of our project\r\ncreate-react-app scotch-auth</code></pre><p>Create the Graphcool server by moving into the React app you just created and running the Graphcool init command:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\"># Move into the project folder\r\ncd scotch-auth\r\n# Create a Graphcool server\r\n# server is the name of the graphcool server folder\r\ngraphcool-framework init server</code></pre><h2>Create React Routes and UIs</h2><p>We need a few routes &mdash; both public and protected:</p><ul><li>A home page (public)</li><li>A profile page (protected)</li><li>An admin page (<strong>protected</strong> and available to only admins)</li><li>An about page (public)</li></ul><p>Create a <code>containers</code> folder and  add <code>home.js</code>, <code>profile.js</code>, <code>admin.js</code>, and <code>about.js</code> as files to represent each of these routes.</p><p><strong>Home.js</strong></p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import React from 'react';\r\nimport Hero from '../components/hero';\r\nconst Home = (props) => (\r\n     &lt;div>\r\n        &lt;Hero page=\"Home\">&lt;/Hero>\r\n        &lt;h2>Home page&lt;/h2>\r\n      &lt;/div>\r\n    )\r\n    export default Home;</code></pre><p><strong>About.js</strong></p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import React from 'react';\r\nimport Hero from '../components/hero';\r\nconst About = (props) => (\r\n     &lt;div>\r\n        &lt;Hero page=\"About\">&lt;/Hero>\r\n        &lt;h2>About page&lt;/h2>\r\n      &lt;/div>\r\n    )\r\n    export default About;</code></pre><p><strong>Profile.js</strong></p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import React from 'react';\r\nimport Hero from '../components/hero';\r\nconst Profile = props => (\r\n     &lt;div>\r\n        &lt;Hero page=\"Profile\">&lt;/Hero>\r\n        &lt;h2>Profile page&lt;/h2>\r\n      &lt;/div>\r\n    );\r\n    export default Profile;</code></pre><p><strong>Admin.js</strong></p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import React from 'react';\r\nimport Hero from '../components/hero';\r\nconst Admin = (props) => (\r\n     &lt;div>\r\n        &lt;Hero>&lt;/Hero>\r\n        &lt;Hero page=\"Admin\">&lt;/Hero>\r\n      &lt;/div>\r\n    )\r\n    export default Admin;</code></pre><p>Each of the page imports and uses <code>Hero</code> to display a landing hero message. Create a <code>components</code> folder and create <code>Hero.js</code> with the following:</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import React from 'react';\r\nimport Nav from './nav'\r\nimport './hero.css'\r\nconst Hero = ({ page }) => (\r\n     &lt;section className=\"hero is-large is-dark\">\r\n        &lt;div className=\"hero-body\">\r\n        &lt;Nav>&lt;/Nav>\r\n          &lt;div className=\"container\">\r\n            &lt;h1 className=\"title\">Scotch Auth&lt;/h1>\r\n            &lt;h2 className=\"subtitle\">Welcome to the Scotch Auth {page}&lt;/h2>\r\n          &lt;/div>\r\n        &lt;/div>\r\n      &lt;/section>\r\n    );\r\n    export default Hero;</code></pre><p>You can add the navigation component as <code>nav.js</code> in the components folder as well. Before we do that, we need to setup routing for the React app and have the pages exposed as routes.</p><p>Start with installing the React Router library:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">yarn add react-router-dom</code></pre><p>Next, provide the router to the App through the <code>index.js</code> entry file:</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">    //...\r\nimport { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';\r\nimport App from './App';\r\n    //...\r\nReactDOM.render(\r\n    &lt;BrowserRouter>\r\n        &lt;App />\r\n      &lt;/BrowserRouter>,\r\n      document.getElementById('root')\r\n    );\r\n    //...\r\n</code></pre><p>Then configure the routes in the App component:</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">    import React, { Component } from 'react';\r\n    import { Switch, Route } from 'react-router-dom';\r\n    import Profile from './containers/profile';\r\n    import About from './containers/about';\r\n    import Admin from './containers/admin';\r\n    import Home from './containers/home';\r\n    class App extends Component {\r\n      render() {\r\n        return (\r\n          &lt;div className=\"App\">\r\n            &lt;Switch>\r\n              &lt;Route exact path=\"/\" component={Home} />\r\n              &lt;Route exact path=\"/about\" component={About} />\r\n              &lt;Route exact path=\"/profile\" component={Profile} />\r\n              &lt;Route exact path=\"/admin\" component={Admin} />\r\n            &lt;/Switch>\r\n          &lt;/div>\r\n        );\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    export default App;</code></pre><p>Back to the navigation component (<code>nav.js</code>), we want to use the <code>Link</code> component from <code>react-router-dom</code> to provision navigation:</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">    import React from 'react';\r\n    import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'\r\n    import './nav.css'\r\n    const Nav = () => {\r\n      return (\r\n        &lt;nav className=\"navbar\">\r\n          &lt;div className=\"navbar-brand\">\r\n            &lt;Link className=\"navbar-item\" to=\"/\">\r\n              &lt;strong>Scotch Auth&lt;/strong>\r\n            &lt;/Link>\r\n          &lt;/div>\r\n          &lt;div className=\"navbar-menu\">\r\n            &lt;div className=\"navbar-end\">\r\n              &lt;Link to=\"/about\" className=\"navbar-item\">\r\n                About\r\n              &lt;/Link>\r\n              &lt;Link to=\"/profile\" className=\"navbar-item\">\r\n                Profile\r\n              &lt;/Link>\r\n              &lt;div className=\"navbar-item join\">\r\n                Join\r\n              &lt;/div>\r\n            &lt;/div>\r\n          &lt;/div>\r\n        &lt;/nav>\r\n      );\r\n    };\r\n    export default Nav;</code></pre><p>This is what the app should look like at this stage:</p><p><img data-src=\"https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_314FE62DA58A8C6BA53A9259B1A05DBDCF00D90AC3786DDEAAD8086A93E6258D_1516190648386_Screen+Shot+2018-01-15+at+3.11.10+PM.png\" alt=\"\"/><img/></p><h2>Create a Graphcool Server</h2><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">graphcool-framework deploy</code></pre><h2>Auth0 for Authentication: Server</h2><p>Let&rsquo;s step away from the client app for a second and get back to the Graphcool server we created earlier. Graphcool has a serverless function concept that allows you to extend the functionalities of your server. This feature can be used to achieve a lot of 3rd party integrations including authentication.</p><p>Some functions for such integrations have been pre-packaged for you so you don&rsquo;t have to create them from scratch. You only need to install the template, uncomment some configuration and types, then update or tweak the code as you wish.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s add the Auth0 template. Make sure you are in the <code>server</code> folder and run the following:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">graphcool-framework add-template graphcool/templates/auth/auth0</code></pre><p>This will create an <code>auth0</code> folder in <code>server/src</code>.

Provide an identifier that is unique to all your existing APIs (URLs are mostly recommended):</p><p><img data-src=\"https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_314FE62DA58A8C6BA53A9259B1A05DBDCF00D90AC3786DDEAAD8086A93E6258D_1516078590207_Screen+Shot+2018-01-15+at+2.23.40+PM.png\" alt=\"\"/><img/></p><p><strong>Uncomment Config</strong>\r\nUncomment the template configuration in <code>server/src/graphcool.yml</code> and update it to look like this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-yml\">    authenticate:\r\n        handler:\r\n          code:\r\n            src: ./src/auth0/auth0Authentication.js\r\n            environment:\r\n              AUTH0_DOMAIN: [YOUR AUTH0 DOMAIN]\r\n              AUTH0_API_IDENTIFIER: [YOUR AUTH0 IDENTIFIER]\r\n        type: resolver\r\n        schema: ./src/auth0/auth0Authentication.graphql</code></pre><p><code>AUTH0_DOMAIN</code> and <code>AUTH0_API_IDENTIFIER</code> will be exposed on <code>process.env</code> in your function as environmental variables.</p><p><strong>Uncomment Model</strong>\r\nThe add template command also generates a type in <code>server/src/types.graphql</code>. It&rsquo;s commented by default. You need to uncomment:</p><pre><code class=\"language-graphql\">    type User @model {\r\n      # Required system field:\r\n      id: ID! @isUnique # read-only (managed by Graphcool)\r\n      # Optional system fields (remove if not needed):\r\n      createdAt: DateTime! # read-only (managed by Graphcool)\r\n      updatedAt: DateTime! # read-only (managed by Graphcool)\r\n      email: String\r\n      auth0UserId: String @isUnique\r\n    }</code></pre><p>You need to remove the <code>User</code> type that was generated when the server was created so that this auth <code>User</code> type can replace it.</p><p><strong>Update Code</strong>\r\nWe need to make some tweaks to the authentication logic. Find the following code block:</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">    jwt.verify(\r\n            token,\r\n            signingKey,\r\n            {\r\n              algorithms: ['RS256'],\r\n              audience: process.env.AUTH0_API_IDENTIFIER,\r\n              ignoreExpiration: false,\r\n              issuer: `https://${process.env.AUTH0_DOMAIN}/`\r\n            },\r\n            (err, decoded) => {\r\n              if (err) throw new Error(err)\r\n              return resolve(decoded)\r\n            }\r\n          )</code></pre><p>And update the <code>audience</code> property in the <code>verify</code> method to <code>aud</code>:</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">    jwt.verify(\r\n            token,\r\n            signingKey,\r\n            {\r\n              algorithms: ['RS256'],\r\n              aud: process.env.AUTH0_API_IDENTIFIER,\r\n              ignoreExpiration: false,\r\n              issuer: `https://${process.env.AUTH0_DOMAIN}/`\r\n            },\r\n            (err, decoded) => {\r\n              if (err) throw new Error(err)\r\n              return resolve(decoded)\r\n            }\r\n          )</code></pre><p>Lastly, the auth token will always encode an email so there is no need doing the following to get the email:</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">    let email = null\r\n    if (decodedToken.scope.includes('email')) {\r\n      email = await fetchAuth0Email(accessToken)\r\n    }</code></pre><p>We can get the email from the <code>decodedToken</code> right away:</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const email = decodedToken.email</code></pre><p>This makes the <code>fetchAuth0Email</code> function useless &mdash; you can remove it.</p><p>Deploy the server to Graphcool by running the following:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">graphcool-framework</code></pre><p>If it&rsquo;s your first time using Graphcool, you should be taken to the following page to create a Graphcool account:</p><p><img data-src=\"https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_314FE62DA58A8C6BA53A9259B1A05DBDCF00D90AC3786DDEAAD8086A93E6258D_1516191405232_Screen+Shot+2018-01-16+at+3.46.30+AM.png\" alt=\"\"/><img/></p><h2>Auth0 for Authentication: Client</h2><p>Our server is set to receive tokens for authentication. You can test this out in the Graphcool playground by running the following command:</p><pre><code>graphcool-framework playground</code></pre><p><img data-src=\"https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_314FE62DA58A8C6BA53A9259B1A05DBDCF00D90AC3786DDEAAD8086A93E6258D_1516081757235_Screen+Shot+2018-01-16+at+4.24.21+AM.png\" alt=\"\"/><img/></p><p>We supply the mutation an Auth0 token and we get a <a href=\"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/scotch_io/~https://www.graph.cool/docs/reference/auth/authentication/authentication-tokens-eip7ahqu5o/#node-tokens\">node token</a> from Graphcool. Let&rsquo;s see how we can get tokens from Auth0.</p><p><strong>Create client</strong>\r\nJust like creating an API, we also need to create a client for the project. The client is used to trigger authentication from the browser. </p><p><strong>Create a Client</strong>\r\nOn your Auth0 dashboard navigation, click clients and create a new client:</p><p><img data-src=\"https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_314FE62DA58A8C6BA53A9259B1A05DBDCF00D90AC3786DDEAAD8086A93E6258D_1516083155222_Screen+Shot+2018-01-15+at+8.46.37+PM.png\" alt=\"\"/><img/></p><p>The application type should be set to Single Page Web Applications which is what a routed React app is.</p><p><strong>Configure callback url</strong>\r\nWhen auth is initiated, it redirects to your Auth0 domain to verify the user. When the user is verified, it needs to redirect the user back to your app. The callback URL is where it comes back to after redirecting. Go to the settings tab of the client you just created and set the callback URL:</p><p><img data-src=\"https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_314FE62DA58A8C6BA53A9259B1A05DBDCF00D90AC3786DDEAAD8086A93E6258D_1516083431288_Screen+Shot+2018-01-16+at+4.02.37+AM.png\" alt=\"\"/><img/></p><p><strong>Auth Service</strong>\r\nWe are done with setting up a client configuration on the Auth0 dashboard. Next thing we want to do is create a service in our React app that exposes few methods. These methods will handle utility tasks like triggering authentication, handling response from Auth0, logging out, etc.</p><p>First install the Auth0 JS library:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">yarn add auth0-js</code></pre><p>Then create a <code>services</code> folder in <code>src</code>. Add a <code>auth.js</code> in the new folder with the following content:</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">    import auth0 from 'auth0-js';\r\n    export default class Auth {\r\n      auth0 = new auth0.WebAuth({\r\n        domain: '[Auth0 Domain]',\r\n        clientID: '[Auth0 Client ID]',\r\n        redirectUri: 'http://localhost:3000/callback',\r\n        audience: '[Auth0 Client Audience]',\r\n        responseType: 'token id_token',\r\n        scope: 'openid profile email'\r\n      });\r\n      handleAuthentication(cb) {\r\n        this.auth0.parseHash({hash: window.location.hash}, (err, authResult) => {\r\n          if (authResult &amp;&amp; authResult.accessToken &amp;&amp; authResult.idToken) {\r\n            this.auth0.client.userInfo(authResult.accessToken, (err, profile) => {\r\n              this.storeAuth0Cred(authResult, profile);\r\n              cb(false, {...authResult, ...profile})\r\n            });\r\n          } else if (err) {\r\n            console.log(err);\r\n            cb(true, err)\r\n          }\r\n        });\r\n      }\r\n      storeAuth0Cred(authResult, profile) {\r\n        // Set the time that the access token will expire at\r\n        let expiresAt = JSON.stringify(\r\n          authResult.expiresIn * 1000 + new Date().getTime()\r\n        );\r\n        localStorage.setItem('scotch_auth_access_token', authResult.accessToken);\r\n        localStorage.setItem('scotch_auth_id_token', authResult.idToken);\r\n        localStorage.setItem('scotch_auth_expires_at', expiresAt);\r\n        localStorage.setItem('scotch_auth_profile', JSON.stringify(profile));\r\n      }\r\n      storeGraphCoolCred(authResult) {\r\n        localStorage.setItem('scotch_auth_gcool_token', authResult.token);\r\n        localStorage.setItem('scotch_auth_gcool_id', authResult.id);\r\n      }\r\n      login() {\r\n        this.auth0.authorize();\r\n      }\r\n      logout(history) {\r\n        // Clear access token and ID token from local storage\r\n        localStorage.removeItem('scotch_auth_access_token');\r\n        localStorage.removeItem('scotch_auth_id_token');\r\n        localStorage.removeItem('scotch_auth_expires_at');\r\n        localStorage.removeItem('scotch_auth_profile');\r\n        localStorage.removeItem('scotch_auth_gcool_token');\r\n        localStorage.removeItem('scotch_auth_gcool_id');\r\n        // navigate to the home route\r\n        history.replace('/');\r\n      }\r\n      isAuthenticated() {\r\n        // Check whether the current time is past the\r\n        // access token's expiry time\r\n        const expiresAt = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('scotch_auth_expires_at'));\r\n        return new Date().getTime() &lt; expiresAt;\r\n      }\r\n      getProfile() {\r\n        return JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('scotch_auth_profile'));\r\n      }\r\n    }</code></pre><p>Let me take some time to walk you through what&rsquo;s going on:</p><ul><li>First thing we did is to create an instance of the Auth0 SDK and configured it using our Auth0 client credentials. This instance is then stored in the instance variable, <code>auth0</code></li><li><code>handleAuthentication</code> will be called by one of our components when authentication is completed. Auth0 will pass the token back to us through URL hash. This method reads and passes this hash.</li><li><code>storeAuth0Cred</code> and <code>storeGraphCoolCred</code> will persist our credentials to localStorage for future use.</li><li>We can call <code>isAuthenticated</code> to check if the token stored in localStorage is still valid.</li><li><code>getProfile</code> returns the JSON payload of the user&rsquo;s profile.</li></ul><p><strong>Callback page</strong>\r\nWe want to redirect the user to our profile page if they are authenticated or send them back to the home page (which is the default page) if they are not. The Callback page is the best candidate for this. First add another route to the routes in <code>App.js</code>:</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">    //...\r\n    import Home from './containers/home';\r\n    import Callback from './containers/callback'\r\n    class App extends Component {\r\n      render() {\r\n        return (\r\n          &lt;div className=\"App\">\r\n            &lt;Switch>\r\n              &lt;Route exact path=\"/\" component={Home} />\r\n              {/* Callback route */}\r\n              &lt;Route exact path=\"/callback\" component={Callback} />\r\n              ...\r\n            &lt;/Switch>\r\n          &lt;/div>\r\n        );\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    export default App;</code></pre><p><code>/callback</code> uses the <code>Callback</code> component which we need to create in <code>src/container/Callback.js</code>:</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">    import React from 'react';\r\n    import { graphql } from 'react-apollo';\r\n    import gql from 'graphql-tag';\r\n    import Auth from '../services/auth'\r\n    const auth = new Auth();\r\n    class Callback extends React.Component {\r\n      componentDidMount() {\r\n        auth.handleAuthentication(async (err, authResult) => {\r\n          // Failed. Send back home\r\n          if (err) this.props.history.push('/');\r\n          // Send mutation to Graphcool with idToken\r\n          // as the accessToken\r\n          const result = await this.props.authMutation({\r\n            variables: {\r\n              accessToken: authResult.idToken\r\n            }\r\n          });\r\n          // Save response to localStorage\r\n          auth.storeGraphCoolCred(result.data.authenticateUser);\r\n          // Redirect to profile page\r\n          this.props.history.push('/profile');\r\n        });\r\n      }\r\n      render() {\r\n        // Show a loading text while the app validates the user\r\n        return &lt;div>Loading...&lt;/div>;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    // Mutation query\r\n    const AUTH_MUTATION = gql`\r\n      mutation authMutation($accessToken: String!) {\r\n        authenticateUser(accessToken: $accessToken) {\r\n          id\r\n          token\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    `;</code></pre><pre><code>// Expose mutation query on `this.props` eg: this.props.authMutation(...)\r\nexport default graphql(AUTH_MUTATION, { name: 'authMutation' })(Callback);</code></pre><p>It uses the <code>handleAuthentication</code> method exposed by <code>Auth</code> to send a mutation to the Graphcool server. We are yet to setup a connection to the server but once we do and attempt to authenticate a user, this callback page will send a write mutation to the Graphcool server to tell the server that the user exists and is allowed to access resources.</p><h2>Setup Apollo and Connect to Server</h2><p>In the Callback component, we used the <code>graphql</code> (which we are yet to install) to connect the component to a mutation. This doesn&rsquo;t imply that there is a connection to the Graphcool server yet. We need to setup this connection using Apollo and then provide the Apollo instance at the top level of our app.</p><p>Start with installing the required dependencies:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">yarn add apollo-client-preset react-apollo graphql-tag graphql</code></pre><p>Update the <code>src/index.js</code> entry file:</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">    import React from 'react';\r\n    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\r\n    import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';\r\n    import './index.css';\r\n    import App from './App';\r\n    import registerServiceWorker from './registerServiceWorker';\r\n    // Import modules\r\n    import { ApolloProvider } from 'react-apollo';\r\n    import { ApolloClient } from 'apollo-client';\r\n    import { HttpLink } from 'apollo-link-http';\r\n    import { InMemoryCache } from 'apollo-cache-inmemory';\r\n    // Create connection link\r\n    const httpLink = new HttpLink({ uri: '[SIMPLE API URL]' });\r\n    // Configure client with link\r\n    const client = new ApolloClient({\r\n      link: httpLink,\r\n      cache: new InMemoryCache()\r\n    });\r\n    // Render App component with Apollo provider\r\n    ReactDOM.render(\r\n      &lt;BrowserRouter>\r\n        &lt;ApolloProvider client={client}>\r\n          &lt;App />\r\n        &lt;/ApolloProvider>\r\n      &lt;/BrowserRouter>,\r\n      document.getElementById('root')\r\n    );\r\n    registerServiceWorker();</code></pre><p>First we imported all the dependencies, then created a link using <code>HttpLink</code>. The argument passed is an object with the URI. You can get your server&rsquo;s URI by running the following command on the server folder:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">graphcool-framework list</code></pre><p>Use the Simple URI to replace the placeholder in the code above.</p><p>Next we created and configured an Apollo client instance with this link as well as a cache. This created client instance is now passed as prop to the Apollo provider which wraps the <code>App</code> component.</p><h2>Test Authentication Flow</h2><p>Now that everything seems intact, let&rsquo;s add an event to the button on our navigation bar to trigger the auth process:</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">    //...\r\n    import Auth from '../services/auth'\r\n    const auth = new Auth();\r\n    const Nav = () => {\r\n      return (\r\n        &lt;nav className=\"navbar\">\r\n          ...\r\n          &lt;div className=\"navbar-menu\">\r\n            &lt;div className=\"navbar-end\">\r\n              ...\r\n              &lt;div className=\"navbar-item join\" onClick={() => {auth.login()}}>\r\n                Join\r\n              &lt;/div>\r\n            &lt;/div>\r\n          &lt;/div>\r\n        &lt;/nav>\r\n      );\r\n    };\r\n    export default Nav;</code></pre><p>When the Join button is clicked, we trigger the <code>auth.login</code> method which would redirect us to our Auth0 domain for authentication:</p><p><img data-src=\"https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_314FE62DA58A8C6BA53A9259B1A05DBDCF00D90AC3786DDEAAD8086A93E6258D_1516107290897_Screen+Shot+2018-01-16+at+4.03.36+AM.png\" alt=\"\"/><img/></p><p>After the user logs in, Auth0 would confirm from the user if (s)he wants you to access his/her profile information:</p><p>After authentication, watch the page move back to <code>/callback</code> and the <code>/profile</code> if authentication was successful.</p><p>You can also confirm that the user is created by going to the data view in your Graphcool dashboard and opening the Users table:</p><p><img data-src=\"https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_314FE62DA58A8C6BA53A9259B1A05DBDCF00D90AC3786DDEAAD8086A93E6258D_1516108557747_Screen+Shot+2018-01-16+at+1.54.21+PM.png\" alt=\"\"/><img/></p><h2>Conditional Buttons</h2><p>We should hide the login button when the user is authenticated and show the logout button rather. Back in the <code>nav.js</code> replace the Join button element with this conditional logic:</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">     {auth.isAuthenticated() ? (\r\n        &lt;div\r\n          className=\"navbar-item join\"\r\n          onClick={() => {\r\n            auth.logout();\r\n          }}\r\n        >\r\n          Logout\r\n        &lt;/div>\r\n      ) : (\r\n        &lt;div\r\n          className=\"navbar-item join\"\r\n          onClick={() => {\r\n            auth.login();\r\n          }}\r\n        >\r\n          Join\r\n        &lt;/div>\r\n      )}</code></pre><p>The <code>Auth</code> services exposes a method called <code>isAuthenticated</code> to check if the token is stored in the localStorage and not expired. Here is an image of the page showing that the user is logged in:</p><p><img data-src=\"https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_314FE62DA58A8C6BA53A9259B1A05DBDCF00D90AC3786DDEAAD8086A93E6258D_1516191614587_Screen+Shot+2018-01-16+at+8.33.59+PM.png\" alt=\"\"/><img/></p><h2>Displaying User&rsquo;s Profile</h2><p>You can also use the Auth service to retrieve a logged in user profile. This profile is already available in the localStorage:</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">    //...\r\n    import Auth from '../services/auth';\r\n    const auth = new Auth();\r\n    const Profile = props => (\r\n      &lt;div>\r\n        //...\r\n        &lt;h2 className=\"title\">Nickname: {auth.getProfile().nickname}&lt;/h2>\r\n      &lt;/div>\r\n    );\r\n    export default Profile;</code></pre><p>The nickname gets printed in the browser:</p><p><img data-src=\"https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_314FE62DA58A8C6BA53A9259B1A05DBDCF00D90AC3786DDEAAD8086A93E6258D_1516191672687_Screen+Shot+2018-01-16+at+8.36.39+PM.png\" alt=\"\"/><img/></p><h2>Securing Graphcool Endpoint</h2><p>We only accounted for generating tokens but what happens when a user tries to access a restricted backend route? Of course, an authenticated user will still have access because we haven&rsquo;t told the server about the token.</p><p>We can send the token as <code>Bearer</code> token in the header of our request. Update the <code>index.js</code> with the following:</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">    //...\r\n    import { ApolloLink } from 'apollo-client-preset'\r\n    const httpLink = new HttpLink({ uri: '[SIMPLE URL]' });\r\n    const middlewareAuthLink = new ApolloLink((operation, forward) => {\r\n      const token = localStorage.getItem('scotch_auth_gcool_token')\r\n      const authorizationHeader = token ? `Bearer ${token}` : null\r\n      operation.setContext({\r\n        headers: {\r\n          authorization: authorizationHeader\r\n        }\r\n      })\r\n      return forward(operation)\r\n    })\r\n    const httpLinkWithAuthToken = middlewareAuthLink.concat(httpLink)</code></pre><p>Instead of creating the Apollo client with just the HTTP Link, we update it to use the middleware we just created which adds a token to all server requests we make:</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">    const client = new ApolloClient({\r\n      link: httpLinkWithAuthToken,\r\n      cache: new InMemoryCache()\r\n    })</code></pre><p>You can then use the token at the server&rsquo;s end to validate the request.</p><h2>Protecting Routes</h2><p>In as much as you have done a great job by securing the most important part of your project which is the server and it&rsquo;s data, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to leave the user hanging at a route where there will be no content. The <code>/profile</code> route needs to be protected from being accessed when user is not authenticated.</p><p>Update <code>App.js</code> to redirect to the home page if the user goes to profile but not authenticated:</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">    //...\r\n    import { Switch, Route, Redirect } from 'react-router-dom';\r\n    //...\r\n    import Auth from './services/auth';\r\n    const auth = new Auth();\r\n    class App extends Component {\r\n      render() {\r\n        return (\r\n          &lt;div className=\"App\">\r\n            &lt;Switch>\r\n              &lt;Route exact path=\"/\" component={Home} />\r\n              &lt;Route exact path=\"/callback\" component={Callback} />\r\n              &lt;Route exact path=\"/about\" component={About} />\r\n              &lt;Route\r\n                exact\r\n                path=\"/profile\"\r\n                render={props =>\r\n                  auth.isAuthenticated() ? (\r\n                    &lt;Profile />\r\n                  ) : (\r\n                    &lt;Redirect\r\n                      to={{\r\n                        pathname: '/'\r\n                      }}\r\n                    />\r\n                  )\r\n                }\r\n              />\r\n            &lt;/Switch>\r\n          &lt;/div>\r\n        );\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    export default App;</code></pre><p>We are still using <code>auth.isAuthenticated</code> to check for authentication. If it returns true, <code>/profile</code> wins, else, <code>/</code> wins.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>We just learned how to authenticate a user using Auth0 in a GraphQL project. What you can do is go to your Auth0 dashboard and add few more social authentication options like Twitter. You will be asked for your Twitter developer credentials which can get from the Twitter Developer website.</p><img align=\"left\" border=\"0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/518136676/0/scotch_io\"/>"

That&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.speedtest.net/global-index\">faster than the network</a> delivers the packets.</p><p>If you use Firefox Nightly or Beta, you can <a href=\"https://lukewagner.github.io/test-tanks-compile-time/\">give it a try</a> on your own device. Even on a pretty average mobile device, we can compile at 8 megabytes per second &mdash;which is faster than the average download speed for pretty much any mobile network.</p><p>This means your code executes almost as soon as it finishes downloading.</p><h3 id=\"1091\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Why is this important?</h3><p>Web performance advocates get prickly when sites ship a lot of JavaScript. That&rsquo;s because downloading lots of JavaScript makes pages load slower.</p><p>This is largely because of the parse and compile times. As <a href=\"https://calendar.perfplanet.com/2017/tracking-cpu-with-long-tasks-api/\">Steve Souders points out</a>, the old bottleneck for web performance used to be the network. But the new bottleneck for web performance is the CPU, and particularly the main thread.</p><p><a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/02.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-31713\" src=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/02-500x295.png\" alt=\"Old bottleneck, the network, on the left.

We also want to start it as early as possible so we&rsquo;re making use of all of the CPU&rsquo;s time. Even better, we can do less CPU work altogether.</p><p>With JavaScript, you can do some of this. You can parse files off of the main thread, as they stream in. But you&rsquo;re still parsing them, which is a lot of work, and you have to wait until they are parsed before you can start compiling. And for compiling, you&rsquo;re back on the main thread. This is because JS is usually <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/02/a-crash-course-in-just-in-time-jit-compilers/\">compiled lazily</a>, at runtime.</p><p><a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/03.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-31714\" src=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/03-500x167.png\" alt=\"Timeline showing packets coming in on the main thread, then parsing happening simultaneously on another thread.

Decoding WebAssembly is much simpler and faster than parsing JavaScript. And this decoding and the compilation can be split across multiple threads.</p><p>This means multiple threads will be doing the baseline compilation, which makes it faster. Once it&rsquo;s done, the baseline compiled code can start executing on the main thread. It won&rsquo;t have to pause for compilation, like the JS does.</p><p><a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/04.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-31715\" src=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/04-500x202.png\" alt=\"Timeline showing packets coming in on the main thread, and decoding and baseline compiling happening across multiple threads simultaneously, resulting in execution starting faster and without compiling breaks.\" width=\"500\" height=\"202\" srcset=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/04-500x202.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/04-250x101.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/04-768x310.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"/><img/></a></p><p>While the baseline compiled code is running on the main thread, other threads work on making a more optimized version.

And think about it&hellip; web performance advocates do get prickly about JS payloads of 150 kB, but an image payload of the same size doesn&rsquo;t raise eyebrows.</p><p><a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/05.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-31716\" src=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/05-500x218.png\" alt=\"Developer advocate on the left tsk tsk-ing about large JS file.

While early WebAssembly tools created large files because they included lots of runtime, there&rsquo;s currently a lot of work to make these files smaller. For example, Emscripten has a <a href=\"https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/issues/5836\">&ldquo;shrinking initiative&rdquo;</a>. In Rust, you can already get pretty small file sizes using the wasm32-unknown-unkown target, and there are tools like <a href=\"https://github.com/alexcrichton/wasm-gc\">wasm-gc</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/fitzgen/wasm-snip\">wasm-snip</a> which can optimize this even more.</p><p>What it does mean is that these WebAssembly files will load much faster than the equivalent JavaScript.</p><p>This is big. As <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wycats/status/942908325775077376\">Yehuda Katz points out</a>, this is a game changer.</p><p><a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/06.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-31717\" src=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/06-500x444.png\" alt=\"Tweet from Yehuda Katz saying it&apos;s possible to parse and compile wasm as fast as it comes over the network.\" width=\"500\" height=\"444\" srcset=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/06-500x444.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/06-250x222.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/06-768x682.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"/><img/></a></p><p>So let&rsquo;s look at how the new compiler works.</p><h3 id=\"4ad4\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Streaming compilation: start compiling earlier</h3><p>If you start compiling the code earlier, you&rsquo;ll finish compiling it earlier. That&rsquo;s what streaming compilation does&hellip; makes it possible to start compiling the&nbsp;.wasm file as soon as possible.</p><p>When you download a file, it doesn&rsquo;t come down in one piece. Instead, it comes down in a series of packets.</p><p>Before, as each packet in the&nbsp;.wasm file was being downloaded, the browser network layer would put it into an ArrayBuffer.</p><p><a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/07.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-31718\" src=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/07-500x255.png\" alt=\"Packets coming in to network layer and being added to an ArrayBuffer\" width=\"500\" height=\"255\" srcset=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/07-500x255.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/07-250x127.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/07-768x392.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"/><img/></a></p><p>Then, once that was done, it would move that ArrayBuffer over to the Web VM (aka the JS engine). That&rsquo;s when the WebAssembly compiler would start compiling.</p><p><a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/08.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-31719\" src=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/08-500x218.png\" alt=\"Network layer pushing array buffer over to compiler\" width=\"500\" height=\"218\" srcset=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/08-500x218.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/08-250x109.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/08-768x334.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"/><img/></a></p><p>But there&rsquo;s no good reason to keep the compiler waiting. It&rsquo;s technically possible to compile WebAssembly line by line. This means you should be able to start as soon as the first chunk comes in.</p><p>So that&rsquo;s what our new compiler does. It takes advantage of WebAssembly&rsquo;s streaming API.</p><p><a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/09.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-31720\" src=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/09-500x132.png\" alt=\"WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming call, which takes a response object with the source file.

Then the compiler can start working on the first chunk while the next one is still being downloaded.</p><p><a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/10.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-31721\" src=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/10-500x248.png\" alt=\"Packets going directly to compiler\" width=\"500\" height=\"248\" srcset=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/10-500x248.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/10-250x124.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/10-768x380.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"/><img/></a></p><p>Besides being able to download and compile the code in parallel, there&rsquo;s another advantage to this.</p><p>The code section of the&nbsp;.wasm module comes before any data (which will go in the module&rsquo;s memory object). So by streaming, the compiler can compile the code while the module&rsquo;s data is still being downloaded. If your module needs a lot of data, the data can be megabytes, so this can be significant.</p><p><a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/11.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-31722\" src=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/11-500x260.png\" alt=\"File split between small code section at the top, and larger data section at the bottom\" width=\"500\" height=\"260\" srcset=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/11-500x260.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/11-250x130.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/11-768x399.png 768w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/11.png 1550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"/><img/></a></p><p>With streaming, we start compiling earlier. But we can also make compiling faster.</p><h3 id=\"23fa\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Tier 1 baseline compiler: compile code&nbsp;faster</h3><p>If you want code to run fast, you need to optimize it. But performing these optimizations while you&rsquo;re compiling takes time, which makes compiling the code slower. So there&rsquo;s a tradeoff.</p><p>We can have the best of both of these worlds. If we use two compilers, we can have one that compiles quickly without too many optimizations, and another that compiles the code more slowly but creates more optimized code.</p><p>This is called a tiered compiler. When code first comes in, it&rsquo;s compiled by the Tier 1 (or baseline) compiler. Then, after the baseline compiled code starts running, a Tier 2 compiler goes through the code again and compiles a more optimized version in the background.</p><p>Once it&rsquo;s done, it hot-swaps the optimized code in for the previous baseline version. This makes the code execute faster.</p><p><a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/12.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-31723\" src=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/12-500x204.png\" alt=\"Timeline showing optimizing compiling happening in the background.\" width=\"500\" height=\"204\" srcset=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/12-500x204.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/12-250x102.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/12-768x313.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"/><img/></a></p><p>JavaScript engines have been using tiered compilers for a long time. However, JS engines will only use the Tier 2 (or optimizing) compiler when a bit of code gets &ldquo;warm&rdquo;&hellip; when that part of the code gets called a lot.</p><p>In contrast, the WebAssembly Tier 2 compiler will eagerly do a full recompilation, optimizing all of the code in the module. In the future, we may add more options for developers to control how eagerly or lazily optimization is done.</p><p>This baseline compiler saves a lot of time at startup. It compiles code 10&ndash;15 times faster than the optimizing compiler. And the code it creates is, in our tests, only 2 times slower.</p><p>This means your code will be running pretty fast even in those first few moments, when it&rsquo;s still running the baseline compiled code.</p><h3 id=\"0453\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Parallelize: make it all even&nbsp;faster</h3><p>In the <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/11/entering-the-quantum-era-how-firefox-got-fast-again-and-where-its-going-to-get-faster/\">article on Firefox Quantum</a>, I explained coarse-grained and fine-grained parallelization. We use both for compiling WebAssembly.</p><p>I mentioned above that the optimizing compiler will do its compilation in the background. This means that it leaves the main thread available to execute the code. The baseline compiled version of the code can run while the optimizing compiler does its recompilation.</p><p>But on most computers that still leaves multiple cores unused. To make the best use of all of the cores, both of the compilers use fine-grained parallelization to split up the work.</p><p>The unit of parallelization is the function. Each function can be compiled independently, on a different core. This is so fine-grained, in fact, that we actually need to batch these functions up into larger groups of functions. These batches get sent to different cores.</p><h3 id=\"5175\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">&hellip; then skip all that work entirely by caching it implicitly (future&nbsp;work)</h3><p>Currently, decoding and compiling are redone every time you reload the page. But if you have the same&nbsp;.wasm file, it should compile to the same machine code.</p><p>This means that most of the time, this work could be skipped.

I&rsquo;ll explain why we do this in a moment.</p><p>For now, in order to get it working and testable, we&rsquo;re going to write it in the portal and fill in the request body to perform the test. But we need to know what Stripe will expect from us first.</p><p><em>Dun dun dun...</em></p><h3>Working With Stripe as a Serverless Function</h3><p>If you check out <a href=\"https://stripe.com/docs/checkout/express\">Stripe's documentation</a>, you can see that we&rsquo;ll need to grab the Stripe token in the dashboard. This will eventually mirror the POST parameters submitted by our form. Stripe makes it easy, so it's fairly straightforward to use their library for the server-side function with Express:</p><pre rel=\"JavaScript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\">app.get('/', (req, res) => res.render('index.pug', { keyPublishable }));\n\napp.post('/charge', (req, res) => {\n  let amount = 500;\n\n  stripe.customers\n    .create({\n      email: req.body.stripeEmail,\n      source: req.body.stripeToken\n    })\n    .then(customer =>\n      stripe.charges.create({\n        amount,\n        description: 'Sample Charge',\n        currency: 'usd',\n        customer: customer.id\n      })\n    )\n    .then(charge => res.render('charge.pug'));\n});\n\napp.listen(4567);</code></pre><p>We won&rsquo;t need to set up all of Node and Express for this, though, as what we really need is the amount, the currency, the description, and the token, which we can integrate with the testing code we were provided earlier in the portal's view of our function. So, let&rsquo;s head over to the <a href=\"https://aka.ms/W6ft1h\">Azure portal</a> where our function lives and update that default testing code to accept the parameters we need for Stripe, and also populate the <code>request.body</code> in the test panel.</p><p>We&rsquo;ll add our Stripe testing key and kick everything off. To be totally sure, we&rsquo;re going to log what we&rsquo;ve gotten started:</p><pre rel=\"JavaScript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\">var stripe = require('stripe')('sk_test_whateveryourtestingkeyisgoeshere');\n// ^ this is a stripe testing key\n\nmodule.exports = function(context, req) {\n  context.log('starting to get down');</code></pre><p>If we have a request body, an email, and a token, then let's get started. We&rsquo;ll create a customer from the email and then use that customer to create the Stripe charges, passing in the amount of the charge as we do so.</p><pre rel=\"JavaScript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\">if (\n  req.body &amp;&amp;\n  req.body.stripeEmail &amp;&amp;\n  req.body.stripeToken &amp;&amp;\n  req.body.stripeAmt\n){\n  stripe.customers\n    .create({\n      email: req.body.stripeEmail,\n      source: req.body.stripeToken\n    })\n    .then(customer => {\n      context.log('starting the stripe charges');\n      stripe.charges.create({\n        amount: req.body.stripeAmt,\n        description: 'Sample Charge',\n        currency: 'usd',\n        customer: customer.id\n      });\n    })\n      ...</code></pre><p>We also want to test if this all completed successfully, or if it errored out. If it did error, we need to log what that error is. We&rsquo;ll also see if the whole thing errored entirely, making sure we&rsquo;re logging everything appropriately along the way. </p><p class=\"explanation\">You'll note that I log a lot. I think it's not enough to know that something has errored. I want to know when the error happened and why so that I can track it down. This makes it much easier to debug if something were to go wrong.</p><pre rel=\"JavaScript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\">      ...\n      .then(charge => {\n        context.log('finished the stripe charges');\n        context.res = {\n          // status: 200\n          body: 'This has been completed'\n        };\n        context.done();\n      })\n      .catch(err => {\n        context.log(err);\n        context.done();\n      });\n  } else {\n    context.log(req.body);\n    context.res = {\n      status: 400,\n      body: \"We're missing something\"\n    };\n    context.done();\n  }\n};</code></pre><p>In the testing area on the right side of <a href=\"https://aka.ms/Vcsomc\">the portal</a>, we&rsquo;ll fill the <code>request.body</code> with the <code>stripeEmail</code>, <code>stripeToken</code> (a testing token in this case), and some random amount for the charge. When we run this, we can see that it works! We get a <span style=\"color:green\">200 OK Status</span>, and we&rsquo;ve logged <code>This has been completed</code> in the output.</p><figure id=\"post-263607\" class=\"align-right media-263607\"><img src=\"https://cdn.css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/test-function-params.jpg\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/css-tricks/image/upload/c_scale, https://css-tricks.com/creating-vue-js-serverless-checkout-part-two/w_1000, https://css-tricks.com/creating-vue-js-serverless-checkout-part-two/f_auto, https://css-tricks.com/creating-vue-js-serverless-checkout-part-two/q_auto/v1512763384/test-function-params_oj3jg8.jpg 1000w, https://res.cloudinary.com/css-tricks/image/upload/c_scale, https://css-tricks.com/creating-vue-js-serverless-checkout-part-two/w_988, https://css-tricks.com/creating-vue-js-serverless-checkout-part-two/f_auto, https://css-tricks.com/creating-vue-js-serverless-checkout-part-two/q_auto/v1512763384/test-function-params_oj3jg8.jpg 988w, https://res.cloudinary.com/css-tricks/image/upload/c_scale, https://css-tricks.com/creating-vue-js-serverless-checkout-part-two/w_902, https://css-tricks.com/creating-vue-js-serverless-checkout-part-two/f_auto, https://css-tricks.com/creating-vue-js-serverless-checkout-part-two/q_auto/v1512763384/test-function-params_oj3jg8.jpg 902w, https://res.cloudinary.com/css-tricks/image/upload/c_scale, https://css-tricks.com/creating-vue-js-serverless-checkout-part-two/w_731, https://css-tricks.com/creating-vue-js-serverless-checkout-part-two/f_auto, https://css-tricks.com/creating-vue-js-serverless-checkout-part-two/q_auto/v1512763384/test-function-params_oj3jg8.jpg 731w, https://res.cloudinary.com/css-tricks/image/upload/c_scale, https://css-tricks.com/creating-vue-js-serverless-checkout-part-two/w_596, https://css-tricks.com/creating-vue-js-serverless-checkout-part-two/f_auto, https://css-tricks.com/creating-vue-js-serverless-checkout-part-two/q_auto/v1512763384/test-function-params_oj3jg8.jpg 596w, https://res.cloudinary.com/css-tricks/image/upload/c_scale, https://css-tricks.com/creating-vue-js-serverless-checkout-part-two/w_433, https://css-tricks.com/creating-vue-js-serverless-checkout-part-two/f_auto, https://css-tricks.com/creating-vue-js-serverless-checkout-part-two/q_auto/v1512763384/test-function-params_oj3jg8.jpg 433w, https://res.cloudinary.com/css-tricks/image/upload/c_scale, https://css-tricks.com/creating-vue-js-serverless-checkout-part-two/w_200, https://css-tricks.com/creating-vue-js-serverless-checkout-part-two/f_auto, https://css-tricks.com/creating-vue-js-serverless-checkout-part-two/q_auto/v1512763384/test-function-params_oj3jg8.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1850px) calc( (100vw - 555px) / 3 )&#10;       (min-width: 1251px) calc( (100vw - 530px) / 2 )&#10;       (min-width: 1086px) calc(100vw - 480px)&#10;       (min-width: 626px)  calc(100vw - 335px)&#10;                           calc(100vw - 30px)\" alt=\"actual function with testing request body params\"/><img/><figcaption>Testing the request body parameters with the actual function in Azure.</figcaption></figure><h3>Github-Hosted Serverless Function</h3><p>Let's put everything in Github now that it's working. One big reason we want to do this is because our function will have a dependency on Stripe&rsquo;s library. If you head over to the <a href=\"https://github.com/sdras/sample-stripe-handler/\">sample-stripe-handler</a> repo I&rsquo;ve created for this tutorial, you&rsquo;ll see a <code>package.json</code> file. The most important lines in that file are these:</p><pre rel=\"JSON\"><code class=\"language-javascript\">\"dependencies\": {\n  \"stripe\": \"^5.3.0\"\n}</code></pre><p>This tells the function to pull in the correct version of the Stripe API that we need to use in order for our app to properly function. As a note, you could also use this method to write other kinds of functions using other libraries.

In this guide, we&rsquo;ll go over some common procedures for managing the Apache server, including stopping, starting, and enabling the service, working with virtual host files and directories, and locating important files and directories on your server. </p><p>This guide is oriented around users working with Apache on Ubuntu. Users working on CentOS and other RHEL-based distributions can check out section one in <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-apache-mysql-php-lamp-stack-on-centos-7\">this tutorial</a> for information about installing Apache on CentOS.</p><p>How To Use This Guide:</p><ul><li>Each section can be used independently of others, so feel free to skip to sections that are relevant to your needs.</li><li>Each command is self-contained, allowing you to substitute your own values for those in red.</li><li>Each section has linked resources, which you can consult for more information about covered topics.</li></ul><h2 id=\"installing-the-apache-service\">Installing the Apache Service</h2><p>To install the Apache service, update your package indexes, then install:</p><pre class=\"code-pre command\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">sudo apt-get update\n</li><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">sudo apt-get install apache2\n</li></ul></code></pre><p>For more details on the installation process, follow our tutorial on <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-the-apache-web-server-on-ubuntu-16-04\">How To Install the Apache Web Server on Ubuntu 16.04</a>.</p><h2 id=\"enabling-and-disabling-the-apache-unit\">Enabling and Disabling the Apache Unit</h2><p>Our Apache service is configured to start automatically at boot. If we wanted to modify this behavior, however, we could type the following: </p><pre class=\"code-pre command\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">sudo systemctl disable apache2.service\n</li></ul></code></pre><p>To allow Apache to start up again at boot:</p><pre class=\"code-pre command\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">sudo systemctl enable apache2.service\n</li></ul></code></pre><h2 id=\"stopping-starting-and-reloading-apache\">Stopping, Starting, and Reloading Apache</h2><p>To stop the Apache server, type the following command:</p><pre class=\"code-pre command\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">sudo systemctl stop apache2\n</li></ul></code></pre><p>To start the Apache server, type:</p><pre class=\"code-pre command\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">sudo systemctl start apache2\n</li></ul></code></pre><p>To stop the service and start it again, type:</p><pre class=\"code-pre command\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">sudo systemctl restart apache2\n</li></ul></code></pre><p>If you are making configuration changes, you can reload Apache without dropping connections.

Dynamic Processing Modules</h2><p>If you are working with a dynamic processing module like PHP, you will create your document root directory as follows:</p><pre class=\"code-pre command\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">sudo mkdir -p /var/www/<span class=\"highlight\">example.com</span>/public_html\n</li></ul></code></pre><p>Assign ownership of the directory to your non-root user, and group ownership to the <code>www-data</code> group:</p><pre class=\"code-pre command\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">sudo chown -R <span class=\"highlight\">sammy</span>:www-data /var/www/<span class=\"highlight\">example.com</span>/public_html\n</li></ul></code></pre><h2 id=\"modifying-configuration-settings\">Modifying Configuration Settings</h2><p>When working with virtual hosts, it is necessary to modify configuration settings to reflect domain specifics, so that Apache can respond correctly to domain requests.</p><p>Open your virtual host configuration file:</p><pre class=\"code-pre command\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/<span class=\"highlight\">example.com</span>.conf\n</li></ul></code></pre><p>Modify the following:</p><pre class=\"code-pre \"><code langs=\"\">ServerAdmin <span

hosts, see our discussion on <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-apache-virtual-hosts-on-ubuntu-16-04\">working with Apache virtual hosts on Ubuntu 16.04</a>.</p><h2 id=\"enabling-and-disabling-configuration-files\">Enabling and Disabling Configuration Files</h2><h3 id=\"virtual-host-files\">Virtual Host Files</h3><p>To enable virtual host configuration files:</p><pre class=\"code-pre command\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">sudo a2ensite <span class=\"highlight\">example.com</span>.conf\n</li></ul></code></pre><p>To disable configuration files (in this particular example, the Apache default virtual host configuration file):</p><pre class=\"code-pre command\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">sudo a2dissite 000-default.conf\n</li></ul></code></pre><h3 id=\"modules\">Modules</h3><p>To enable the modules found in <code>/etc/apache2/mods-available</code>, use the following command:</p><pre class=\"code-pre command\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">sudo a2enmod <span class=\"highlight\">example_mod</span></li></ul></code></pre><p>To disable a specific module:</p><pre class=\"code-pre command\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">sudo a2dismod <span class=\"highlight\">example_mod</span></li></ul></code></pre><h3 id=\"configuration-files\">Configuration Files</h3><p>To enable the configuration files in <code>/etc/apache2/conf-available</code>&mdash;files not associated with virtual hosts&mdash;type: </p><pre class=\"code-pre command\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">sudo a2enconf <span class=\"highlight\">example-conf</span></li></ul></code></pre><p>To disable a configuration file:</p><pre class=\"code-pre command\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">sudo a2disconf <span class=\"highlight\">example-conf</span></li></ul></code></pre><h2 id=\"configuration-testing\">Configuration Testing</h2><p>Any time you make changes to configuration files in Apache, be sure to run the following command to check for syntax errors:</p><pre class=\"code-pre command\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">sudo apache2ctl configtest\n</li></ul></code></pre><h2 id=\"important-files-and-directories\">Important Files and Directories</h2><p>As you continue working with Apache, you will encounter the following directories and files:</p><h3 id=\"content\">Content</h3><ul><li><code>/var/www/html</code>: This directory holds the web content of your site, and is its default root. You can modify Apache&rsquo;s default configuration settings to point to other directories within <code>var/www</code>.</li></ul><h3 id=\"server-configuration\">Server Configuration</h3><ul><li><p><code>/etc/apache2</code>: The configuration directory in Apache, home to all of its configuration files.</p></li><li><p><code>/etc/apache2/apache2.conf</code>: Apache&rsquo;s primary configuration file, which stores its global configuration settings. Other files in the configuration directory are loaded from this file. It also stores the <code>FollowSymLinks</code> directives, which control configuration enabling and disabling.</p></li><li><p><code>/etc/apache2/sites-available/</code>: This directory holds virtual host configuration files, which are enabled through links to the <code>sites-enabled</code> directory. Modification to server block files happens in this directory, and is enabled through the <code>a2ensite</code> command.</p></li><li><p><code>/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/</code>: Activated virtual host configuration files are stored here. When Apache starts or reloads, it reads the configuration files and links in this directory as it complies a full configuration.</p></li><li><p><code>/etc/apache2/conf-available</code> and <code>/etc/apache2/conf-enabled</code>: In the same relationship as <code>sites-available</code> and <code>sites-enabled</code>, these directories house configuration fragments that are unattached to virtual host configuration files.</p></li><li><p><code>/etc/apache2/mods-available</code> and <code>/etc/apache2/mods-enabled</code>: Containing modules that are available and enabled, these directories have two components: files ending in <code>.load</code>, which contain fragments that load particular modules, and files ending in <code>.conf</code>, which store the configurations of these modules.</p></li></ul><h3 id=\"server-logs\">Server Logs</h3><ul><li><p><code>/var/log/apache2/access.log</code>: This file contains every request to the web server unless Apache&rsquo;s configuration settings have been modified.</p></li><li><p><code>/var/log/apache2/error.log</code>: This file contains errors. To modify the amount of detail in the error logs, modify the <code>LogLevel</code> directive in <code>/etc/apache2/apache2.conf</code>.</p></li></ul><p>Another way to access information about the Apache unit is through the <code>journald</code> component, which collects log information from applications and the kernel. To see entries for the Apache unit, type:</p><pre class=\"code-pre command\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">sudo journalctl -u apache2\n</li></ul></code></pre><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>In this guide, we&rsquo;ve covered some common procedures for managing the Apache server, including stopping, starting, and enabling the service, working with virtual host files and directories, and locating important files and directories on your server.

The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/9/11/16287812/amazon-new-fire-tv-2017-alexa\" data-href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/9/11/16287812/amazon-new-fire-tv-2017-alexa\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">new Amazon Fire TV </a>devices also have Alexa built in, enabling streaming video to a flat screen display to be controlled by your voice.</p><p name=\"208b\" id=\"208b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The Echo Show initially included the capability to play videos from YouTube, but lately, Google and Amazon <a href=\"http://variety.com/2017/digital/news/amazon-echo-show-sales-down-youtube-1202582660/\" data-href=\"http://variety.com/2017/digital/news/amazon-echo-show-sales-down-youtube-1202582660/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">have been fighting</a> about it&rsquo;s availability. This impacted the popularity of the product given how big of a feature video playing was.</p><p name=\"8e37\" id=\"8e37\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">At the <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/google-home-assistant-smart-displays-echo-show-lenovo-lg-sony-jbl-ces-2018/\" data-href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/google-home-assistant-smart-displays-echo-show-lenovo-lg-sony-jbl-ces-2018/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2018 CES</a>, multiple consumer electronics companies announced that they were launching a Google Home compatible device with a screen. This makes the voice market even more competitive. One solution to the YouTube compatibility challenge is to host video content directly on Amazon. The following describes how to create a custom skill for the Echo Show that does just that.</p><h3 name=\"fe39\" id=\"fe39\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">How to Create a Custom Video Skill on&nbsp;Alexa</h3><p name=\"4114\" id=\"4114\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Building your own video channel is surprisingly easy using Alexa and a handful of AWS services. Here is the architecture featuring a custom Alexa skill that packages content to play on an Echo Show. The AWS storage service (S3) stores the media, and streams it to the device based on instructions given by the custom skill.</p><figure name=\"f261\" id=\"f261\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 387px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 55.300000000000004%;\"></div><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*VyKktdyrvhd8IOypj5C09Q.png\" data-width=\"741\" data-height=\"410\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*VyKktdyrvhd8IOypj5C09Q.png\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*VyKktdyrvhd8IOypj5C09Q.png\"/></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Component Level Architecture for Custom Video&nbsp;Skill</figcaption></figure><p name=\"a96e\" id=\"a96e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Producing content for this is comparable to that required for a YouTube channel. The current version of the Echo Show (as well as the Echo Spot) have specifications around the media type to follow. For example, the video should use an mp4 extension and a standard <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264/MPEG-4_AVC\" data-href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264/MPEG-4_AVC\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">H.264 compression</a> format. The resolution of the video quality should be no greater than 1280x720 in pixel size. These constraints provide a high quality video stream on the Show&rsquo;s seven inch display comparable to that of a HD video player.</p><h3 name=\"88ad\" id=\"88ad\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Building the Custom Video&nbsp;Skill</h3><p name=\"bd63\" id=\"bd63\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Creating a video channel requires authoring a custom skill for Alexa and publishing it to the public skill store. There are a number of features needed for navigating the content in the channel and playing the videos. This section will cover these steps in detail. For a working example, try out the Piano Teacher skill that is already in the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Piano-Teacher-video-Echo-Show/dp/B078M9843X/\" data-href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Piano-Teacher-video-Echo-Show/dp/B078M9843X/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Alexa store</a>. It is a skill that contains short videos with beginner lessons on how to play the piano, as well as note-by-note video instructions on how to play simple songs. <a href=\"https://github.com/terrenjpeterson/pianoplayer\" data-href=\"https://github.com/terrenjpeterson/pianoplayer\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Here</a> is the repo that contains all the source code needed, as well as detailed instructions to configure and deploy.</p><p name=\"1ec1\" id=\"1ec1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">There are three features required to make a video channel.</p><p name=\"2f22\" id=\"2f22\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">1&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;Render a background image when the skill is initially launched. This establishes the channel&rsquo;s brand.<br/>2&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;Build navigation controls to browse and select which video to play. This includes handling touch gestures on the Echo Show screen.<br/>3&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;Delegate control to the device to play a video once content is selected.</p><h4 name=\"4618\" id=\"4618\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">1&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;Brand with a Background Image</h4><p name=\"b306\" id=\"b306\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">To facilitate the building of custom video skills, Alexa provides a series of templates. I use the &ldquo;BodyTemplate1&rdquo; template to render the background image when the skill is first invoked. When generating the metadata within the Alexa Developer Console, check the second and third boxes on the global fields screen (Video App &amp; Render Template).</p><figure name=\"d1f8\" id=\"d1f8\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 251px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 35.9%;\"></div><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*pJ5qiTiXFxqUn3bknTU3aA.png\" data-width=\"1622\" data-height=\"582\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*pJ5qiTiXFxqUn3bknTU3aA.png\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*pJ5qiTiXFxqUn3bknTU3aA.png\"/></div></figure><p name=\"36df\" id=\"36df\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Setting these attributes enables additional APIs within the custom skill. Additional standard intents are required to use the APIs. These are created when building the intent model in skills kit. They are as follows:</p><ul class=\"postList\"><li name=\"cc87\" id=\"cc87\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">AMAZON.NavigateSettingsIntent</li><li name=\"8d33\" id=\"8d33\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">AMAZON.NextIntent</li><li name=\"d036\" id=\"d036\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">AMAZON.PageDownIntent</li><li name=\"0b5b\" id=\"0b5b\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">AMAZON.PageUpIntent</li><li name=\"17c8\" id=\"17c8\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">AMAZON.PreviousIntent</li><li name=\"0de2\" id=\"0de2\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">AMAZON.ScrollDownIntent</li><li name=\"1750\" id=\"1750\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">AMAZON.ScrollLeftIntent</li><li name=\"ae70\" id=\"ae70\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">AMAZON.ScrollRightIntent</li><li name=\"3b13\" id=\"3b13\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">AMAZON.ScrollUpIntent</li></ul><p name=\"65ca\" id=\"65ca\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">No coding in the Lambda function is required for these events, as the device will handle them natively. They just need to be included in your custom skills intent model.</p><p name=\"3b25\" id=\"3b25\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Rendering a background image requires two utility methods that are already distributed in the standard Alexa SDK. The skill creates two identifiers to illustrate how they are used.</p><pre name=\"85f9\" id=\"85f9\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\">// utility methods for creating Image and TextField objects</pre><pre name=\"bda5\" id=\"bda5\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\">const makePlainText = Alexa.utils.TextUtils.makePlainText;<br/>const makeImage     = Alexa.utils.ImageUtils.makeImage;</pre><p name=\"b390\" id=\"b390\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">Next, I add an identifier for the location of your jpg/png file that serves as the background image. This object needs to be publicly available. The pixel size is 1024x600 based on the dimensions of the Echo Show. You don&rsquo;t need to provide a separate image for the smaller Echo Spot. Alexa creates the smaller image based on the original file sized for the Show.</p><pre name=\"5265\" id=\"5265\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\">// This is a public endpoint - the easiest way is to host in S3<br/>// It needs to be SSL enabled (which S3 does for you)</pre><pre name=\"4cb8\" id=\"4cb8\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\">const backgroundImage = &lsquo;https://s3.amazonaws.com/.../image.jpg';</pre><p name=\"6070\" id=\"6070\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">Next, add the following code to render the background image when the skill gets launched, along with any other audio messages.</p><pre name=\"9e3c\" id=\"9e3c\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf--startsWithSingleQuote graf-after--p\">&lsquo;LaunchRequest&rsquo;: function () { <br/>  const builder = new Alexa.templateBuilders.BodyTemplate1Builder();<br/>  const template = builder.setTitle(&lsquo;Your Personal Instructor&rsquo;)<br/>      .setBackgroundImage(makeImage(backgroundImage))<br/>      .setTextContent(makePlainText(&lsquo;Piano Teacher&rsquo;)) <br/>      .build();</pre><pre name=\"2b7e\" id=\"2b7e\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\">  // check if the device has a video screen<br/>  if (this.event.context.System.device.supportedInterfaces.Display){      <br/>    this.response.speak(welcomeMessage)<br/>        .listen(repeatWelcomeMessage).renderTemplate(template);<br/>    this.emit(&lsquo;:responseReady&rsquo;);<br/>  } else {<br/>    // handle error of not having a video screen to play<br/>    this.emit(&lsquo;:tell&rsquo;, nonVideoMessage);<br/>  } <br/>},</pre><h4 name=\"4a1c\" id=\"4a1c\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--pre\">2&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;Content Navigation</h4><p name=\"0b3b\" id=\"0b3b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">The navigation for the content takes advantage of the flexibility of the Alexa platform. The viewer can use either their voice or fingers to navigate the content catalog, selecting exactly what they would like to view. This requires using the list template within the Alexa SDK, as well as handling events triggered from the user touching the screen.</p><p name=\"8269\" id=\"8269\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Here are the different options that the user may request using either their voice or touching the screen.</p><figure name=\"04db\" id=\"04db\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 609px; max-height: 385px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 63.2%;\"></div><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*MZ15RJGJIelGh7rGS6rwwg.png\" data-width=\"609\" data-height=\"385\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*MZ15RJGJIelGh7rGS6rwwg.png\"/></div></figure><p name=\"f0bd\" id=\"f0bd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Rendering a list of what content is available is central to the user experience. I use &lsquo;ListTemplate1&rsquo; from the Alexa SDK to render the list of videos. Scrolling up and down can be done through either voice or touch, and is handled by the device with no coding required.</p><p name=\"2384\" id=\"2384\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The response object that is sent to list the content contains an array listing what is available on the channel. In my skill, this list is read by the Alexa voice, and is rendered visually on the screen. Here is an example of what it looks like.</p><figure name=\"9cfd\" id=\"9cfd\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 525px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 75%;\"></div><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*fY7VyOuWddQPeAcaHYTNuQ.jpeg\" data-width=\"2016\" data-height=\"1512\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*fY7VyOuWddQPeAcaHYTNuQ.jpeg\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*fY7VyOuWddQPeAcaHYTNuQ.jpeg\"/></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Screenshot of Piano Teacher Skill on an Alexa&nbsp;Show</figcaption></figure><p name=\"f042\" id=\"f042\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Within the code, the content is externalized into an array object (songs.json) that contains a list of videos, as well as metadata about the location of each media file. Each item in the list has a unique token assigned. Here is a sample of the layout written in standard Javascript object notation:</p><pre name=\"7298\" id=\"7298\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\">[ <br/>  { &ldquo;requestName&rdquo;: &ldquo;Silent Night&rdquo;, <br/>    &ldquo;listSong&rdquo;:true, <br/>    &ldquo;token&rdquo;:&rdquo;song001\", <br/>    &ldquo;difficulty&rdquo;:&rdquo;Moderate&rdquo;, <br/>    &ldquo;videoObject&rdquo;: &ldquo;SilentNight.mp4&rdquo;, <br/>    &ldquo;audioObject&rdquo;: &ldquo;SilentNight.mp3&rdquo; <br/>  }, <br/>  { &ldquo;requestName&rdquo;: &ldquo;Mary Had a Little Lamb&rdquo;, <br/>    &ldquo;listSong&rdquo;:true, <br/>    &ldquo;token&rdquo;:&rdquo;song002\", <br/>    &ldquo;difficulty&rdquo;:&rdquo;Easy&rdquo;, <br/>    &ldquo;videoObject&rdquo;: &ldquo;MaryHadLittleLamb.mp4&rdquo;, <br/>    &ldquo;audioObject&rdquo;: &ldquo;MaryHadLittleLamb.mp3&rdquo; <br/>  },<br/>...<br/>]</pre><p name=\"41db\" id=\"41db\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">Here is the code that converts the array into the response needed by Alexa. Included is embedding the token for each item in the array.</p><pre name=\"7954\" id=\"7954\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\">// these are the songs that recordings have been made for<br/>var songs = require(\"data/songs.json\");</pre><pre name=\"afc8\" id=\"afc8\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\">// create List<br/>const itemImage = null; <br/>const listItemBuilder = new Alexa.templateBuilders.ListItemBuilder(); <br/>const listTemplateBuilder = new Alexa.templateBuilders.ListTemplate1Builder();</pre><pre name=\"abfe\" id=\"abfe\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\">// build an array of all available songs <br/>for (i = 0; i &lt; songs.length; i++ ) { <br/>  if (songs[i].listSong) { <br/>    // pull attributes from song array and apply to the list<br/>    listItemBuilder.addItem(null, songs[i].token,<br/>      makePlainText(songs[i].requestName),<br/>      makePlainText(songs[i].difficulty)); <br/>     message = message + songs[i].requestName + &ldquo;, &ldquo;;<br/>  } <br/>} <br/>message = message + &ldquo;Just select on the screen a song, or request by saying something &ldquo; + &ldquo;like, Teach me how to play &ldquo; + songs[0].requestName + &ldquo;.&rdquo;;</pre><pre name=\"39eb\" id=\"39eb\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\">// now create the response object using the SDK<br/>const listItems = listItemBuilder.build(); <br/>const imageLoc = pianoStrings; <br/>const listTemplate = listTemplateBuilder.setToken(&lsquo;listToken&rsquo;)<br/>  .setTitle(&lsquo;Available Song List&rsquo;) .setListItems(listItems)<br/>  .setBackgroundImage(makeImage(imageLoc)) <br/>  .build(); this.response.speak(message).listen(noSongRepeatMessage).renderTemplate(listTemplate); <br/>this.emit(&lsquo;:responseReady&rsquo;);</pre><p name=\"68cb\" id=\"68cb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">The Lambda function handles the &lsquo;ElementSelected&rsquo; event invoked by the Echo Show. The request object sent by the device to the custom skill contains the token used to translate what was selected by the user.</p><pre name=\"ace4\" id=\"ace4\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\">// this function is invoked from the 'ElementSelected' event<br/>&lsquo;ScreenSongSelected&rsquo;: function() { <br/>  console.log(&ldquo;Element Selected:&rdquo; + this.event.request.token);<br/>  var videoName = &ldquo;&rdquo;;<br/>  // match token to song name and find the video object to play <br/>  for (i = 0; i &lt; songs.length; i++ ) { <br/>    if (songs[i].token === this.event.request.token) { <br/>      console.log(&ldquo;Play &ldquo; + songs[i].requestName);<br/>      videoName = songs[i].videoObject;<br/>    } <br/>  } <br/>  const videoClip = videoLoc + videoName;<br/>  this.response.playVideo(videoClip); this.emit(&lsquo;:responseReady&rsquo;); <br/>},</pre><p name=\"ba40\" id=\"ba40\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">The Lambda function uses the token it receives and finds the media file corresponding to the unique identifier. Control is then transferred to the device with the appropriate video.</p><h4 name=\"73fd\" id=\"73fd\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">3&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;Delegate Control to the Video&nbsp;Player</h4><p name=\"c808\" id=\"c808\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Once the video that needs to be played is found, the endpoint of the media is added to the response. This requires a few lines of code within the Lambda function.</p><p name=\"00c5\" id=\"00c5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">First, identify a folder in the S3 bucket where the video files will be stored.</p><pre name=\"a26e\" id=\"a26e\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\">// These are the folders where the mp4 files are located</pre><pre name=\"9ff8\" id=\"9ff8\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\">const videoLoc = &lsquo;https://s3.amazonaws.com/&hellip;/media/';</pre><p name=\"bae8\" id=\"bae8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">Then specify the exact file based on what was identified by the user. Metadata is added that contains more information about the video.</p><pre name=\"a641\" id=\"a641\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\">if (this.event.context.System.device.supportedInterfaces.VideoApp) {<br/>  const videoClip = videoLoc + videoObject; // endpoint of the file<br/>  // this will be rendered when the user selects video controls<br/>  const metadata = { <br/>    &lsquo;title&rsquo;: slots.SongName.value <br/>  };<br/>  this.response.playVideo(videoClip, metadata);<br/>} else {<br/>  // handle error - and close the session<br/>  this.emit(&lsquo;:tell&rsquo;, nonVideoMessage);<br/>}</pre><p name=\"ba05\" id=\"ba05\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">After this code executes, the Alexa device will take over navigation of playing the video. The user can either use their voice or touch the screen to pause, rewind, fast-forward, etc. Here is what the screen looks like when playing a video, including the Metadata title at the top.</p><figure name=\"3370\" id=\"3370\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 525px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 75%;\"></div><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*Moht514Lujp7zwa1e3gTMg.jpeg\" data-width=\"4032\" data-height=\"3024\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Moht514Lujp7zwa1e3gTMg.jpeg\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Moht514Lujp7zwa1e3gTMg.jpeg\"/></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Screen shot of Piano Teacher Skill on an Alexa&nbsp;Show</figcaption></figure><p name=\"e18d\" id=\"e18d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">When the video playing on the device is complete, the skill can be used again to select more content.</p><h3 name=\"e948\" id=\"e948\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Summary</h3><p name=\"357a\" id=\"357a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3 graf--trailing\">Building the custom skill can be done using the example above as a template in just a few hours. The Alexa certification process takes just a day or two, then the skill (and content within it) will be available for anyone with an Echo Show. As a fan of YouTube, I hope to be able to use it on my Alexa device soon, but there&rsquo;s also a way for content publishers to go around it.</p></div></div></section></div>"

Despite starting out with monolith at his previous company Belly, he discovered that&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;in the right circumstances&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;starting with a monolith isn&rsquo;t always the best way to go.</p><p name=\"24fc\" id=\"24fc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">At Belly, Darby and his team broke down their monolith into a fairly large microservices architecture. They managed to get it to a good place, but only after months of trials and tribulations migrating to microservices.</p><p name=\"3a03\" id=\"3a03\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">With this experience fresh in his mind, he approached his new project at Gamut a bit more cautious of microservices.</p><p name=\"c5d5\" id=\"c5d5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">&ldquo;I was firmly a member of Team Monolith. [I thought] let&rsquo;s build a single application and just pull things apart later if we start to feel pain,&rdquo; he said.</p><p name=\"44d6\" id=\"44d6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">While this was a greenfield project, Darby&rsquo;s team was small, and he had aggressive timelines, so on the surface, a monolith seemed like the obvious choice.</p><p name=\"7094\" id=\"7094\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">&ldquo;[But with this new project], I was anxious to not repeat the mistakes of the past.&rdquo;</p><p name=\"2566\" id=\"2566\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">And with that, he found himself faced with a decision we all struggle with: should we start with a monolith or microservices, and how do we decide?</p><h3 name=\"e55c\" id=\"e55c\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Conventional Wisdom About Monoliths</h3><p name=\"44e6\" id=\"44e6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Many startups begin with a monolith, because its very structure lends itself well to small teams and offers other advantages like less operational overhead. Also, monoliths often just have one massive code base. Server side application logic, front end client side logic, background jobs, etc, are all defined in the same code base. This means that if developers want to make any changes or updates, they need to build and deploy the entire stack all at once.</p><p name=\"f971\" id=\"f971\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">A monolith isn&rsquo;t a dated architecture that we need to leave in the past. In certain circumstances, a monolith is ideal. I spoke to Steven Czerwinski, Head of Engineering at Scaylr and former Google employee, to better understand this.</p><p name=\"a95f\" id=\"a95f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">&ldquo;Even though we had had these positive experiences of using microservices at Google, we [at Scaylr] went [for a monolith] route because having one monolithic server means less work for us as two engineers,&rdquo; he explained. This was back in the early beginnings of Scalyr.</p><p name=\"2614\" id=\"2614\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In other words, because his team was small, a unified application was more manageable in comparison to splitting everything up into microservices.</p><h3 name=\"813f\" id=\"813f\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">The Alternative of Microservices</h3><p name=\"44e7\" id=\"44e7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Zachary Crockett, CTO of Particle, told me this during an interview:</p><blockquote name=\"8724\" id=\"8724\" class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">&ldquo;When discussing microservices, people tend to focus on one end of that spectrum: many tiny applications passing too many messages to each other. At the other end of the spectrum you have a giant monolith doing too many things. For any real system, there are many possible service oriented architectures between those two extremes.&rdquo;</blockquote><p name=\"6413\" id=\"6413\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">The microservice architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services. Each runs in its own process and communicates with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API.</p><p name=\"8e2f\" id=\"8e2f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">These services are built around business capabilities and are independently deployable by fully automated deployment machinery. There is a bare minimum of centralized management of these services, which may be written in different programming languages and may use different data storage technologies.</p><p name=\"bfc0\" id=\"bfc0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Microservices do have distinct advantages:</p><ul class=\"postList\"><li name=\"cbdf\" id=\"cbdf\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Better Organization:</strong> Microservice architectures are typically better organized. Each microservice has a very specific job, and it is not concerned with the jobs of other components.</li><li name=\"d94f\" id=\"d94f\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Decoupled:</strong> Decoupled services are also easier to recompose and reconfigure to serve the purposes of different apps (for example, serving both the web clients and public API). They also allow for fast, independent delivery of individual parts within a larger, integrated system.</li><li name=\"aff5\" id=\"aff5\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Performance:</strong> Under the right circumstances, microservices can also have performance advantages depending on how they&rsquo;re organized. It&rsquo;s possible to isolate hot services and scale them independently of the rest of the app.</li><li name=\"5a76\" id=\"5a76\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Fewer Mistakes:</strong> Microservices enable parallel development by establishing a hard-to-cross boundary between different parts of your system. By doing this, you make it hard&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;or at least harder&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;to do the wrong thing: namely, connecting parts that shouldn&rsquo;t be connected, and coupling too tightly those that need to be connected.</li></ul><p name=\"e1a9\" id=\"e1a9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">But they also create unique challenges:</p><ul class=\"postList\"><li name=\"e503\" id=\"e503\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Cross-cutting Concerns Across Each Service:</strong> As you&rsquo;re building a new microservice architecture, you&rsquo;re likely to discover lots of cross-cutting concerns that you did not anticipate at design time. You&rsquo;ll either need to incur the overhead of separate modules for each cross-cutting concern (i.e. testing), or encapsulate cross-cutting concerns in another service layer that all traffic gets routed through. Eventually, even monolithic architectures tend to route traffic through an outer service layer for cross-cutting concerns, but with a monolithic architecture, it&rsquo;s possible to delay the cost of that work until the project is much more mature.</li><li name=\"9943\" id=\"9943\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Higher Operational Overhead:</strong> Microservices are frequently deployed on their own virtual machines or containers, causing a proliferation of VM wrangling work. These tasks are frequently automated with container fleet management tools.</li></ul><h3 name=\"30f9\" id=\"30f9\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--li\">Which Model Is Right For&nbsp;You?</h3><p name=\"3764\" id=\"3764\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Interviews with dozens of CTOs taught us that one approach does not fit all. Their experiences serve as a useful rubric for you to decide between a monolith and microservices. Answering these questions should guide you in the right direction:</p><h4 name=\"d016\" id=\"d016\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Are You In Familiar Territory?</h4><p name=\"8256\" id=\"8256\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Darby and his team at Gamut were able to delve directly into Microservices because he had experience with eCommerce platforms, and his company had a wealth of knowledge concerning the needs and demands of their customers. If he had been traveling down an unknown path, a monolith may have actually been the safer option.</p><p name=\"b562\" id=\"b562\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Similarly, startups are often born out of pains experienced at previous companies. In those scenarios, sometimes it&rsquo;s quite clear that scaling is going to be a primary requirement, especially in infrastructure-based services like cloud log management.</p><h4 name=\"4318\" id=\"4318\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Is Your Team Prepared?</h4><p name=\"0c8b\" id=\"0c8b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Does your team have experience with microservices? What if you quadruple the size of your team within the next year&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;are microservices ideal for that situation? Evaluating these dimensions of your team is crucial to the success of your project.</p><p name=\"199e\" id=\"199e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Julien Lemoine, CTO at Algolia, chimed in on this point:</p><blockquote name=\"4af4\" id=\"4af4\" class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">&ldquo; We have always started with a microservices approach. The main goal was to be able to use different technology to build our service, for two big&nbsp;reasons:</blockquote><blockquote name=\"fdd8\" id=\"fdd8\" class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--pullquote\">1) We want to use the best tool for each service. Our search API is highly optimized at the lowest level and C++ is the perfect language for that. That said, using C++ for everything is a waste of productivity, especially to build a dashboard!</blockquote><blockquote name=\"66cf\" id=\"66cf\" class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--pullquote\">2) The want the best talents and using only one technology would limit our options. This is why we have different languages in the company, Go is less perfect than C++ when you want to optimize everything at the millisecond level but is the perfect language when performance is still key (processing of logs where we process several terabytes of logs per day, using ruby or python would be a waste of&nbsp;CPU).&rdquo;</blockquote><p name=\"7d82\" id=\"7d82\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">If your team is prepared, starting with microservices is wise as it allows you to get used to the rhythm of developing in a microservice environment, right from the start.</p><h4 name=\"2811\" id=\"2811\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">How&rsquo;s Your Infrastructure?</h4><p name=\"0dd1\" id=\"0dd1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">In reality, you&rsquo;re going to need cloud-based infrastructure to make microservices work for your project. David Strauss, CTO of Pantheon, explained it thus:</p><blockquote name=\"3c34\" id=\"3c34\" class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">&ldquo;[Previously], you would want to start with a monolith because you wanted to deploy one database server. The idea of having to set up a database server for every single microservice and then scale out was a mammoth task. Only a huge, tech-savvy organization could do&nbsp;that.</blockquote><blockquote name=\"5e14\" id=\"5e14\" class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--pullquote\">Whereas today with services like Google Cloud and Amazon AWS, you have many options for deploying tiny things without needing to own the persistence layer for each&nbsp;one.&rdquo;</blockquote><h4 name=\"82e1\" id=\"82e1\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--pullquote\">Evaluate The Business&nbsp;Risk</h4><p name=\"9aa4\" id=\"9aa4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">You may think microservices is the &ldquo;right&rdquo; way to go as a tech-savvy startup with high ambitions. But microservices pose a business risk. David Strauss explained:</p><blockquote name=\"9236\" id=\"9236\" class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">&ldquo;A lot of teams overbuild their project initially; everyone wants to think their startup will be the next unicorn and that they should, therefore, build everything with microservices or some other hyper-scalable infrastructure. But that&rsquo;s usually wrong, almost all the&nbsp;time.&rdquo;</blockquote><p name=\"5b81\" id=\"5b81\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">One example of this from his early days at Pantheon was a system that was limited to a single VM. They thought it would be a month or two until they&rsquo;d be forced to scale it. It ended up being over a year&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;and they ended up scaling it a completely different way than they had anticipated.</p><p name=\"2716\" id=\"2716\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">He went on to say that, in these cases, the areas that you thought you needed to scale are probably not the parts that will need to scale first. This results in misplaced effort even for the systems that will need to scale.</p><h3 name=\"9f93\" id=\"9f93\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Context is Key&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;Rules of Thumb For Choosing an Architecture</h3><p name=\"32ac\" id=\"32ac\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">We&rsquo;ve taken hours of interviews with successful CTO&rsquo;s and distilled them into general guidelines to follow when choosing your service architecture.</p><h4 name=\"65c5\" id=\"65c5\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">When To Start With A&nbsp;Monolith</h4><p name=\"3276\" id=\"3276\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Here are some scenarios that indicate that you should start your next project using monolithic architecture.</p><ul class=\"postList\"><li name=\"2fce\" id=\"2fce\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Your Team Is At Founding Stage:</strong> Your team is small, between 2&ndash;5 members, and is thus unable to tackle a broader and high-overhead microservices architecture.</li><li name=\"7c76\" id=\"7c76\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">You&rsquo;re Building An Unproven Product or Proof of Concept:</strong> Are you building an unproven product in the market? If it&rsquo;s a new idea, it&rsquo;s likely going to pivot and evolve over time, so a monolith is ideal to allow for rapid product iteration. Same applies to a proof of concept where your goal is just to learn as much as possible as quickly as possible, even if you end up throwing it away.</li><li name=\"b183\" id=\"b183\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">You Have No Microservices Experience:</strong> If your team has no prior experience with microservices, unless you can justify taking the risk of learning &ldquo;on the fly&rdquo; at such an early stage, it&rsquo;s likely another sign you should stick to a monolith to start.</li></ul><h4 name=\"7606\" id=\"7606\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--li\">When To Start With Microservices</h4><p name=\"2beb\" id=\"2beb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Here are some scenarios that indicate that you should start your next project using microservices:</p><ul class=\"postList\"><li name=\"7ca8\" id=\"7ca8\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">You Need Quick, Independent Service Delivery:</strong> Microservices allow for fast, independent delivery of individual parts within a larger, integrated system. Note that, depending on your team size, it can take time to see service delivery gains versus starting with monolith.</li><li name=\"0a90\" id=\"0a90\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">A Piece of Your Platform Needs to Be Extremely Efficient:</strong> If your business is doing intensive processing of petabytes of log volume, you&rsquo;ll likely want to build that service out in a very efficient language (i.e. C++) while your user dashboard may be built in Ruby on Rails.</li><li name=\"154b\" id=\"154b\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">You Plan To Grow Your Team:</strong> Starting with microservices gets your team used to developing in separate small services from the beginning. And having teams separated by service boundaries makes it much easier to scale up your team when you need to without introducing exponential complexity.</li></ul><h3 name=\"f3ad\" id=\"f3ad\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--li\">Choose the Architecture You Can Comfortably Live&nbsp;With</h3><p name=\"24f3\" id=\"24f3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Microservices has become an increasingly popular service architecture, but it&rsquo;s essential to understand whether it&rsquo;s the best fit for your project. Your own context, evaluated against the above considerations, is the key to deciding if you should start with monolith or microservices.</p><p name=\"628c\" id=\"628c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">Jake is the CEO of <a href=\"https://buttercms.com/\" data-href=\"https://buttercms.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ButterCMS</a>.

In both cases, we're mounting our <code>App</code> component to the root element and setting up our state management piece.

But the implementation differs significantly.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In Redux</strong>, a Reducer is a function which takes in the current state and an action, and returns the new state. We're keeping track of a list of <code>todos</code> and the <code>visibilityFilter</code> here, so we use Redux's <code>combineReducers</code> to keep track of both.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In Microcosm</strong>, a Domain is a class built to manage a section of state, and handle actions individually. For each action, you specify a handler function which takes in the previous state, as well as <strong>the returned value of the action</strong>, and returns the new state.</p>\n\n<p>In our Microcosm setup, we called <code>addDomain('todos', Todos)</code> and <code>addDomain('currentFilter', Filter)</code>. This hooks up our two domains to the <code>todos</code> and <code>currentFilter</code> keys of our application's state object, and each domain becomes responsible for managing their own isolated section of state.</p>\n\n<p>A major difference here is the way that actions are handled on a lower level, and that's because actions themselves are fundamentally different in the two frameworks (more on that later).</p>\n\n<h2>Todo List</h2>\n\n<p>Enough with the behind-the-scenes stuff though, let's take a look at how the two frameworks enable you to pull data out of state, display it, and trigger actions.

Define yourself some <code>mapStateToProps</code> and <code>mapDispatchToProps</code> functions, pass those into <code>connect</code>, which gives you a function, which you finally pass your view component to. Slightly confusing at first glance and strange that your props become a melting pot of state and actions. But, once you become familiar with this it's not a big deal - set up the boiler plate code once, and then add the meat of your application in between the lines.</p>\n\n<p>Looking at Microcosm however, we see the power of a Microcosm Presenter. A Presenter lets you grab what you need out of state when you define <code>getModel</code>, and also maintains a reference to the parent Repo so you can dispatch actions in a more readable fashion. Presenters can be used to help with simple scenarios like we see here, or you can make use of their powerful forking functionality to build an \"app within an app\" (David Eisinger wrote a <a href=\"https://www.viget.com/articles/using-microcosm-presenters-to-manage-complex-features\">fantastic post</a> on that), but that's not what we're here to discuss, so let's move on!</p>\n\n<h2>Add Todo</h2>\n\n<p>Let's look at what handling form input looks like in the two frameworks.</p>\n\n  </div>\n</div>\n  <div class=\"code-comparison page-block\" data-module=\"CodeComparison\" data-collapse=\"false\">\n  <div class=\"code-comparison__wrapper\" id=\"code-blocks-19213\">\n\n    <div class=\"code-block code-comparison__block\">\n      <span class=\"code-comparison__block__language\">Javascript</span>\n      <pre class=\"line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-javascript\">// Redux\n\n// containers/AddTodo.js\nimport React from &#039;react&#039;\nimport { connect } from &#039;react-redux&#039;\nimport { addTodo } from &#039;../actions&#039;\n\nlet AddTodo = ({ dispatch }) =&gt; {\n  let input\n\n  return (\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      &lt;form\n        onSubmit={e =&gt; {\n          dispatch(addTodo(input.value))\n        }}\n      &gt;\n        &lt;input ref={node =&gt; {input = node}} /&gt;\n        &lt;button type=&quot;submit&quot;&gt;Add Todo&lt;/button&gt;\n      &lt;/form&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  )\n}\nAddTodo = connect()(AddTodo)\n\nexport default AddTodo</code></pre>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"code-block code-comparison__block\">\n      <span class=\"code-comparison__block__language\">Javascript</span>\n      <pre class=\"line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-javascript\">// Microcosm\n\n// views/addTodo.js\nimport React from &#039;react&#039;\nimport ActionForm from &#039;microcosm/addons/action-form&#039;\nimport { addTodo } from &#039;../actions&#039;\n\nlet AddTodo = () =&gt; {\n  return (\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      &lt;ActionForm action={addTodo}&gt;\n        &lt;input name=&quot;text&quot; /&gt;\n        &lt;button&gt;Add Todo&lt;/button&gt;\n      &lt;/ActionForm&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  )\n}\n\nexport default AddTodo</code></pre>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"wrapper--narrow page-block\">\n  <div class=\"text\">\n    <p>With Redux, we again make use of <code>connect</code>, but this time without any of the dispatch/state/prop mapping (just when you thought you understood how <code>connect</code> worked). That passes in <code>dispatch</code> as an available prop to our functional component which we can then use to send actions out.</p>\n\n<p>Microcosm has a bit a syntactic sugar for us here with the <code>ActionForm</code> addon. <a href=\"http://code.viget.com/microcosm/api/action-form.html\">ActionForm</a> will serialize the form data and pass it along to the action you specify (<code>addTodo</code> in this instance). Along these lines, Microcosm provides an <code>ActionButton</code> addon for easy button-to-action functionality, as well as <code>withSend</code> which operates similarly to Redux's <code>connect</code>/<code>dispatch</code> combination if you like to keep things more low-level.</p>\n\n<p><em>In the interest of time, I'm going to skip over the Filter Link implementations, the comparison is similar to what we've already covered.</em></p>\n\n<h2>Actions</h2>\n\n<p>The way that Microcosm handles <a href=\"http://code.viget.com/microcosm/api/actions.html\">Actions</a> is a major reason that it stands out in the pool of state management frameworks. Let's look at some code, and then I'll touch on some high level points.</p>\n\n  </div>\n</div>\n  <div class=\"code-comparison page-block\" data-module=\"CodeComparison\" data-collapse=\"false\">\n  <div class=\"code-comparison__wrapper\" id=\"code-blocks-19215\">\n\n    <div class=\"code-block code-comparison__block\">\n      <span class=\"code-comparison__block__language\">Javascript</span>\n      <pre class=\"line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-javascript\">// Redux\n\n// actions/index.js\nlet nextTodoId = 0\n\nexport const addTodo = text =&gt; {\n  return {\n    type: &#039;ADD_TODO&#039;,\n    id: nextTodoId++,\n    text\n  }\n}\n\nexport const setVisibilityFilter = filter =&gt; {\n  return {\n    type: &#039;SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER&#039;,\n    filter\n  }\n}\n\nexport const toggleTodo = id =&gt; {\n  return {\n    type: &#039;TOGGLE_TODO&#039;,\n    id\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"code-block code-comparison__block\">\n      <span class=\"code-comparison__block__language\">Javascript</span>\n      <pre class=\"line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-javascript\">// Microcosm\n\n// actions/index.js\nlet nextTodoId = 0\n\nexport function addTodo(data) {\n  return {\n    id: nextTodoId++,\n    completed: false,\n    text: data.text\n  }\n}\n\nexport function setFilter(newFilter) {\n  return newFilter\n}\n\nexport function toggleTodo(id) {\n  return id\n}</code></pre>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"wrapper--narrow page-block\">\n  <div class=\"text\">\n    <p>At first glance, things look pretty similar here. In fact, the only major difference in defining actions here is the use of action types in Redux. In Microcosm, domains register to the actions themselves instead of a type constant, removing the need for that set of boilerplate code.</p>\n\n<p>The important thing to know about Microcosm actions however is how powerful they are. In a nutshell, actions are first-class citizens that get things done, and have a predictable lifecycle that you can make use of. The simple actions here return JS primitives (similar to our Redux implementation), but you can write these action creators to return functions, promises, or generators (observables supported in the next release).</p>\n\n<p>Let's say you return a promise that makes an API request. Microcosm will instantiate the action with an <code>open</code> status, and when the promise comes back, the action's status will update automatically to represent the new situation (either <code>update</code>, <code>done</code>, or <code>error</code>). Any Domains (guardians of the state) that care about that action can react to the individual lifecycle steps, and easily update the state depending on the current action status.</p>\n\n<h2>Action History</h2>\n\n<p>The last thing I'll quickly cover is a feature that is unique to Microcosm. All Microcosm apps have a <a href=\"http://code.viget.com/microcosm/api/history.html\">History</a>, which maintains a <strong>chronological list</strong> of dispatched actions, and knows how to reconcile action updates in the order that they were pushed. So if a handful of actions are pushed, it doesn't matter in what order they succeed (or error out). Whenever an Action changes its status, History alerts the Domains about the Action, and then moves down the chronological line alerting the Domains of any subsequent Actions as well. The result is that your application state will always be accurate based on the order in which actions were dispatched.</p>\n\n<p>This topic deserves its own blog post to be honest, it's such a powerful feature that takes care of so many problems for you, but is a bit tough to cram into one paragraph. If you'd like to learn more, or are confused by my veritably confusing description, check out the <a href=\"http://code.viget.com/microcosm/api/history.html#reconciling\">History Reconciling</a> docs.</p>\n\n<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>\n\n<p>Redux is a phenomenal library, and the immense community that's grown with it over the last few years has brought forth every middleware you can think of in order to get the job done. And while that community has grown, we've been plugging away on Microcosm internally, morphing it to suit our ever growing needs, making it as performant and easy to use as possible because it makes our jobs easier. We love working with it, and we'd love to share the ride with anyone who's curious.</p>\n\n<p>Should you be compelled to give Microcosm a go, here are a few resources to get you running:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://code.viget.com/microcosm/guides/quickstart.html\">Microcosm Quickstart</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://code.viget.com/microcosm/api/microcosm.html\">Documentation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/vigetlabs/microcosm\">Github</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://code.viget.com/microcosm/guides/contributing.html\">Contributing</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n  </div>\n</div>",

We're keeping track of a list of <code>todos</code> and the <code>visibilityFilter</code> here, so we use Redux's <code>combineReducers</code> to keep track of both.</p><p><strong>In Microcosm</strong>, a Domain is a class built to manage a section of state, and handle actions individually. For each action, you specify a handler function which takes in the previous state, as well as <strong>the returned value of the action</strong>, and returns the new state.</p><p>In our Microcosm setup, we called <code>addDomain('todos', Todos)</code> and <code>addDomain('currentFilter', Filter)</code>.

Define yourself some <code>mapStateToProps</code> and <code>mapDispatchToProps</code> functions, pass those into <code>connect</code>, which gives you a function, which you finally pass your view component to. Slightly confusing at first glance and strange that your props become a melting pot of state and actions. But, once you become familiar with this it's not a big deal - set up the boiler plate code once, and then add the meat of your application in between the lines.</p><p>Looking at Microcosm however, we see the power of a Microcosm Presenter. A Presenter lets you grab what you need out of state when you define <code>getModel</code>, and also maintains a reference to the parent Repo so you can dispatch actions in a more readable fashion. Presenters can be used to help with simple scenarios like we see here, or you can make use of their powerful forking functionality to build an \"app within an app\" (David Eisinger wrote a <a href=\"https://www.viget.com/articles/using-microcosm-presenters-to-manage-complex-features\">fantastic post</a> on that), but that's not what we're here to discuss, so let's move on!</p><h2>Add Todo</h2><p>Let's look at what handling form input looks like in the two frameworks.</p></div></div><div class=\"code-comparison page-block\" data-module=\"CodeComparison\" data-collapse=\"false\"><div class=\"code-comparison__wrapper\" id=\"code-blocks-19213\"><div class=\"code-block code-comparison__block\"><span class=\"code-comparison__block__language\">Javascript</span><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-javascript\">// Redux\n\n// containers/AddTodo.js\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { connect } from 'react-redux'\nimport { addTodo } from '../actions'\n\nlet AddTodo = ({ dispatch }) => {\n  let input\n\n  return (\n    &lt;div>\n      &lt;form\n        onSubmit={e => {\n          dispatch(addTodo(input.value))\n        }}\n      >\n        &lt;input ref={node => {input = node}} />\n        &lt;button type=\"submit\">Add Todo&lt;/button>\n      &lt;/form>\n    &lt;/div>\n  )\n}\nAddTodo = connect()(AddTodo)\n\nexport default AddTodo</code></pre></div><div class=\"code-block code-comparison__block\"><span class=\"code-comparison__block__language\">Javascript</span><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-javascript\">// Microcosm\n\n// views/addTodo.js\nimport React from 'react'\nimport ActionForm from 'microcosm/addons/action-form'\nimport { addTodo } from '../actions'\n\nlet AddTodo = () => {\n  return (\n    &lt;div>\n      &lt;ActionForm action={addTodo}>\n        &lt;input name=\"text\" />\n        &lt;button>Add Todo&lt;/button>\n      &lt;/ActionForm>\n    &lt;/div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default AddTodo</code></pre></div></div></div><div class=\"wrapper--narrow page-block\"><div class=\"text\"><p>With Redux, we again make use of <code>connect</code>, but this time without any of the dispatch/state/prop mapping (just when you thought you understood how <code>connect</code> worked). That passes in <code>dispatch</code> as an available prop to our functional component which we can then use to send actions out.</p><p>Microcosm has a bit a syntactic sugar for us here with the <code>ActionForm</code> addon. <a href=\"http://code.viget.com/microcosm/api/action-form.html\">ActionForm</a> will serialize the form data and pass it along to the action you specify (<code>addTodo</code> in this instance). Along these lines, Microcosm provides an <code>ActionButton</code> addon for easy button-to-action functionality, as well as <code>withSend</code> which operates similarly to Redux's <code>connect</code>/<code>dispatch</code> combination if you like to keep things more low-level.</p><p><em>In the interest of time, I'm going to skip over the Filter Link implementations, the comparison is similar to what we've already covered.</em></p><h2>Actions</h2><p>The way that Microcosm handles <a href=\"http://code.viget.com/microcosm/api/actions.html\">Actions</a> is a major reason that it stands out in the pool of state management frameworks. Let's look at some code, and then I'll touch on some high level points.</p></div></div><div class=\"code-comparison page-block\" data-module=\"CodeComparison\" data-collapse=\"false\"><div class=\"code-comparison__wrapper\" id=\"code-blocks-19215\"><div class=\"code-block code-comparison__block\"><span class=\"code-comparison__block__language\">Javascript</span><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-javascript\">// Redux\n\n// actions/index.js\nlet nextTodoId = 0\n\nexport const addTodo = text => {\n  return {\n    type: 'ADD_TODO',\n    id: nextTodoId++,\n    text\n  }\n}\n\nexport const setVisibilityFilter = filter => {\n  return {\n    type: 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER',\n    filter\n  }\n}\n\nexport const toggleTodo = id => {\n  return {\n    type: 'TOGGLE_TODO',\n    id\n  }\n}</code></pre></div><div class=\"code-block code-comparison__block\"><span class=\"code-comparison__block__language\">Javascript</span><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-javascript\">// Microcosm\n\n// actions/index.js\nlet nextTodoId = 0\n\nexport function addTodo(data) {\n  return {\n    id: nextTodoId++,\n    completed: false,\n    text: data.text\n  }\n}\n\nexport function setFilter(newFilter) {\n  return newFilter\n}\n\nexport function toggleTodo(id) {\n  return id\n}</code></pre></div></div></div><div class=\"wrapper--narrow page-block\"><div class=\"text\"><p>At first glance, things look pretty similar here. In fact, the only major difference in defining actions here is the use of action types in Redux. In Microcosm, domains register to the actions themselves instead of a type constant, removing the need for that set of boilerplate code.</p><p>The important thing to know about Microcosm actions however is how powerful they are. In a nutshell, actions are first-class citizens that get things done, and have a predictable lifecycle that you can make use of. The simple actions here return JS primitives (similar to our Redux implementation), but you can write these action creators to return functions, promises, or generators (observables supported in the next release).</p><p>Let's say you return a promise that makes an API request. Microcosm will instantiate the action with an <code>open</code> status, and when the promise comes back, the action's status will update automatically to represent the new situation (either <code>update</code>, <code>done</code>, or <code>error</code>). Any Domains (guardians of the state) that care about that action can react to the individual lifecycle steps, and easily update the state depending on the current action status.</p><h2>Action History</h2><p>The last thing I'll quickly cover is a feature that is unique to Microcosm. All Microcosm apps have a <a href=\"http://code.viget.com/microcosm/api/history.html\">History</a>, which maintains a <strong>chronological list</strong> of dispatched actions, and knows how to reconcile action updates in the order that they were pushed. So if a handful of actions are pushed, it doesn't matter in what order they succeed (or error out). Whenever an Action changes its status, History alerts the Domains about the Action, and then moves down the chronological line alerting the Domains of any subsequent Actions as well. The result is that your application state will always be accurate based on the order in which actions were dispatched.</p><p>This topic deserves its own blog post to be honest, it's such a powerful feature that takes care of so many problems for you, but is a bit tough to cram into one paragraph. If you'd like to learn more, or are confused by my veritably confusing description, check out the <a href=\"http://code.viget.com/microcosm/api/history.html#reconciling\">History Reconciling</a> docs.</p><h2>Closing Thoughts</h2><p>Redux is a phenomenal library, and the immense community that's grown with it over the last few years has brought forth every middleware you can think of in order to get the job done. And while that community has grown, we've been plugging away on Microcosm internally, morphing it to suit our ever growing needs, making it as performant and easy to use as possible because it makes our jobs easier. We love working with it, and we'd love to share the ride with anyone who's curious.</p><p>Should you be compelled to give Microcosm a go, here are a few resources to get you running:</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://code.viget.com/microcosm/guides/quickstart.html\">Microcosm Quickstart</a></li><li><a href=\"http://code.viget.com/microcosm/api/microcosm.html\">Documentation</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/vigetlabs/microcosm\">Github</a></li><li><a href=\"http://code.viget.com/microcosm/guides/contributing.html\">Contributing</a></li></ul></div></div>"

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Package managing on windows is always a nightmare and it's been no different here. I primarily use C++ at work and C# at home so I'm spoiled when it comes to pleasant IDE's (though I wouldn't say C++ is always pleasant, it at least immediately works in an IDE). I was looking to get into Haskell because friends use it and I wanted to learn a functional lang, but because I've been spoiled and I've always used Windows, I'm extremely bad at command-line style installation/config.</p><p>So I install full Haskell Platform as the site recommends, <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/oLaeXgh.png\">and that all works</a>.</p><p>Then, I want to set up Atom because it seemed to have the best tooling available with debuggers and etc. So I go to install dependencies, and every guide I can find says <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/335ANc3.png\">stuff like this</a>.</p><p>So I'm like, okay, I'll take it slow, never used this before and don't know how it looks if there's a problem; let's just try ghc-mod?</p><p><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/wPb9y8l.png\">And everything is bad already.</a> All my packages are too new.</p><p>The recommended \"stack solver\" just wants me to make a package/project and install packages local to the project (I don't want a project right now, these should be global packages and hooks for Atom/other IDEs; not to mention if I <em>do</em> make a project it still has the same errors), so the only lead I can find at all is adding the extra-deps as suggested. So, I try that and every one I add, it fixes the warning in the list. Great! Just one last one, and, uh,</p><p><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/7f4R5GG.png\">It just refuses to detect base in extra-deps.</a></p><p>No matter what I do I can't get it to detect this. And setting allow-newer:true above extra-deps also does nothing. So I'm at a complete standstill after even the first package. How the heck do I get this to work and why are all windows package managers <em>so bad</em> :(</p></div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Jewelots\"> /u/Jewelots </a><br/><span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/7r0776/how_to_get_running_well_on_windows_package/\">[link]</a></span><span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/7r0776/how_to_get_running_well_on_windows_package/\">[comments]</a></span>"

Spread over three days and two different hotels, this conference included over 500 different sessions.</p><p>Buried in the program, during the morning on the last day, was a grab bag paper session titled <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/2018/preliminary/1294\"><em>Radically Rethinking Economic Policy</em></a>. The final paper discussed in this session should command our attention, because its coauthors include, in addition to four well-respected economics researchers, someone who I&rsquo;ve long promoted as one of the most brilliant and outrageous thinkers pondering the digital world: <a href=\"http://www.jaronlanier.com\">Jaron Lanier</a>.</p><p>The paper, which is titled <em><a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/2018/preliminary/paper/2Y7N88na\">&ldquo;Should We Treat Data as Labor? Moving Beyond &lsquo;Free&rsquo;,&rdquo;</a>&nbsp;</em>translates the basic premises of Lanier&rsquo;s 2013 book, <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1451654979/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=stuhac-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1451654979&amp;linkId=a70fcc1c735879d7fa5ac3469804fca9\">Who Owns the Future?</a>,&nbsp;</em>into more precise economic terminology.</p><p>This short paper contains many points worthy of longer discussion. I&rsquo;ll focus here on its main conceit.</p><p>The authors note that a core resource of the digital economy is the data produced by users of services like Facebook and Google, which can then be used to train machine learning algorithms to do valuable things like precisely targeting advertisements or more accurately processing natural language.</p><p>The current market treats <em><strong>data as capital</strong></em>: the &ldquo;natural exhaust from consumption to be collected by firms&rdquo; for use in training their AI-driven golden gooses.</p><p>Lanier and company suggest an alternative:&nbsp;<em><strong>data as labor</strong></em>. Put simply, if a major platform monopoly wants your data to help build a multi-billion dollar empire, they must pay you for it. Offering a free service in return is not enough.</p><p>The idea of treating data as labor, which might require massive intervention in the form of user unions and government regulation, is an example of a <em><strong>radical market,&nbsp;</strong></em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691177503/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=stuhac-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0691177503&amp;linkId=3951678473636ee72558c97bb61b0b1f\">an emerging concept in economic theory</a> in which new markets are constructed specifically to act as countervailing forces to existing markets that are causing trouble.</p><p>To Lanier et. al., the data as labor radical market could defend against our worse fears about AI stealing our jobs by more equitably distributing the spoils of this next technological boom &mdash; supporting a middle class of &ldquo;data workers&rdquo; who find dignified employment in providing the quality data the boom will require.</p><p>To be clear, I&rsquo;m not fully convinced. As Lanier himself admits, more formal analysis is needed to explore whether the vague notion of a dignified data worker class is actually feasible (regardless of the difficulties inherent in enforcing such a system). But I love the discussion.</p><p>The attention economy is not a minor bubble or teen fad, it&rsquo;s a major force in our society that deserves the type of serious analysis that thinkers like Lanier and his economist coauthors are demonstrating. I hope this trend of careful but radical thinking continues.</p><p>#####</p><p><em>For a nice introduction to Lanier, I suggest <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/1/16/16897738/jaron-lanier-interview\">Ezra Klein&rsquo;s recent podcast interview</a>, as well as Lanier&rsquo;s&nbsp;epochal&nbsp;2010 manifesto, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307389979/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=stuhac-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0307389979&amp;linkId=ede03fda11afa4e01d4b73e59b1eb294\">You Are Not a Gadget.</a>&nbsp;He also just published an acclaimed memoir titled&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071RBPV1V/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=stuhac-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B071RBPV1V&amp;linkId=514846b8d956dff69bee87c9eba7f101\">Dawn of the New Everything</a>.<br/></em></p><p>(<em>Photo by <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/vanz/144476685/in/photolist-dLtTk-dLtM4-7DKc7r-65mzKE-8nZyCQ-ADo4o-8aQsdV-st6Ma-8nZyCb-dCd7bb-7B3sxA-btigYx-exLgw-uaWDZ9-exLhd-7Syb7o-2zfJ5q-7DUDcX-8Y8Pbk-2uNGyB-8CsYyy-95mUcq-8Y8Pai-95nkd5-7APs3D-fjrsR3-aBpQzA-aBpQuL-7A66gS-9KPEr3-9KPEFN-9KPFf7-dFAMq-8Y8PaK-dtvtQa-6soSwd-Gqk8jU-2xpsN8-f7VVvR-ehZgfm-uaWjEs-uaWcYw-uaWPAL-usxck8-fzdU13-9MS74b-e1dMfC-o2vLt-8CpF6X-7RquRM\">Luca Vanzella</a></em>.)</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/StudyHacks/~4/CueIxQc-MKw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/><img/>"

        "title": "Measuring Transactional Integrity in Airbnb’s Distributed Payment Ecosystem",
        "description": "<p>By Ninad Khisti &amp; William&nbsp;Betz</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*dn-dSIRAG0QeH2BILkpaQQ.png\"/><img/></figure><p><em>In a distributed payment ecosystem, it is critical to accurately measure and track a transaction&rsquo;s end to end state and contents to ensure consistency throughout the payment cycle. Without robust tracking, data leakage and errors can occur, resulting in either lost revenue or increased costs for all parties in the payment cycle, including the consumers, merchants, gateways, and acquirers.<br/><br/>Transactional integrity is hard to measure precisely in a distributed payment system. With multiple systems and entities involved in any given transaction, tracking the state of a payment can be tedious and hard to obtain in a timely fashion.<br/><br/>With big data tools, Airbnb is tracing the contents of every transaction through various payment states to ensure every piece of the payments cycle lands in a consistent state. The reconciliation process not only produces data and insights that enable the team to track and mitigate unexpected transaction behavior, but also enables the system to &ldquo;self-heal&rdquo; certain aberrations when detected.</em></p><h3>Background</h3><p>With rapidly emerging payments technologies, merchants face a continually evolving landscape when it comes to processing payment transactions. The advent of new value-add entities, such as payment gateways, has offered increasingly large benefits to merchants, providing simplification by offering vaulting services and single API integration for payments processing. By integrating with payment gateways, Airbnb has been able to rapidly scale worldwide through various processing entities with minimal changes to our online transaction processing.</p><p>This being said, integration with any new value-add entity comes at a cost. Each new entity in the payments process adds an additional layer where a transaction&rsquo;s integrity can be effected. A breakdown in a transaction&rsquo;s integrity can create headaches for community members, increased workload for customer support, and an operational efficiency overhead.</p><h3>What Is Transactional Integrity?</h3><p>Generally, a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_transaction\">transaction</a> represents a unit of work performed in RDMS (Relational Database Management System) with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomicity_(database_systems)\">atomic</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency_(database_systems)\">consistent</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_(database_systems)\">isolated</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durability_(database_systems)\">durable</a> properties. When it comes to payments, transactional integrity represents a no-surprise, accurate money movement. Accuracy of a financial transaction can be verified by various attributes, such as amount, currency, status, payment method, and even timeliness.</p><p>At Airbnb, transactional integrity encompasses both internal and external money movements. This means that we not only expect full consistency of payment attributes between our internal systems, but also across all external partners that the payment&nbsp;touches.</p><h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>Airbnb is an accommodation platform connecting guests and hosts to enable travel worldwide. Payments at Airbnb is a key factor to enable community trust, both on- and off-platform. To maintain this trust, it is crucial that we properly handle payments between our guest and host communities with the utmost accuracy.<br/><br/>Airbnb is a global brand operating in over 190 countries and 40 currencies around the world, including markets that are hard to reach and not commonly supported in the payments ecosystem. A singular processor relationship to move money globally simply does not exist in today&rsquo;s world. As a result, Airbnb integrates with a handful of gateways and dozens of processors to achieve global coverage and payments redundancy. This system includes processors with varying degrees of maturity in their systems, different modes of integration (API call, batch and URL redirect), and widely differing transaction settlement periods. For example, Airbnb supports the processing of completely synchronous payment methods, such as major credit/debit card networks, as well as payment methods that can take up to several days to settle, such as <a href=\"https://business.ebanx.com/en/blog/boleto-bancario-everything-you-need-to-know\">Brazilian Boletos</a>.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*H2mMCoYw7_-Gs7OSzztGfA.jpeg\"/><img/><figcaption>Diagram Depicting Various Payment Integration Methods At&nbsp;Airbnb</figcaption></figure><p>For a traditional online merchant, money flows into the system as a result of online purchases. More recently however, with the sharing economy on the rise, we have started to witness an increase in two-sided marketplaces. Airbnb is one such example&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;connecting travelers and hosts worldwide. As a result, Payments at Airbnb handles bi-directional money flow, not only handling payments into our platform, but also all payment outflows to&nbsp;hosts.</p><p>A large portion of the money flowing out to our hosts occurs with direct integration with banks via batch processing. Batch transaction processing involves two steps. First, we send a collection of transaction requests to a bank in a compliant format. We then process the response file(s) that bank sends us back containing responses to the transaction requests. While batch processes are suitable for larger transaction volume processing, the batching process, by nature, leaves our systems out-of-sync until batch response files are processed. Because this process can take up to several hours to complete, batch processing can prove to be a difficult barrier in maintaining transactional integrity.</p><p>Even in the most simple example of an Airbnb transaction, a reservation between guest and host, there are at least two financial transactions associated with it. The first financial transaction occurs when the guest pays for the reservation to Airbnb, and the second occurs when Airbnb pays the host within hours of rendering the service. However, travel plans change more often than we think. Additional payment features such as alterations, deposits/installments, group travel, tax withholding, VAT etc. all dramatically increase the number and complexity of financial transactions associated with a reservation. Additionally, the fact that many reservations on Airbnb platform are cross border, involving multiple currencies, further increases the complexity of our money movements.</p><h3>Airbnb&rsquo;s &ldquo;New&rdquo; Payment&nbsp;Gateway</h3><p>Airbnb has seen an explosive growth in its marketplace in recent years, with payments being a critical underpinning of the expansion. Until recent years, most of Airbnb&rsquo;s business and financial transaction logic was performed in a monolithic rails application.<br/><br/>To improve scalability, Airbnb is making a significant investment in Service Oriented Architecture. As part of this strategy, we set out to build an internal payment gateway to encapsulate all network communication to/from various processors and handle the &ldquo;burden&rdquo; of executing money movements for the application. Our new payment gateway is a Java Service with a dedicated datastore. This datastore hosts various payment methods and serves as a system of records for financial transactions.<br/><br/>This new service represents two distinct challenges with transactional integrity. First, an additional internal gateway increases the number of hops made during payment execution and if it behaves in an inconsistent manner or fails to process a gateway or processor response, it will create an &ldquo;out-of-sync&rdquo; transaction. Secondly, while we ramp up traffic on the new payment gateway there will be two transaction stores with Airbnb internal system&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;a legacy transaction store and a new payment gateway transaction store. We cannot afford any drift in consistency within our two data stores for any significant amount of time. These two challenges warranted additional consideration for transactional integrity.</p><h3>What Is An &ldquo;out-of-sync&rdquo; Transaction?</h3><p>If any system in the payments processing chain fails to respond and/or its subsequent system fails to properly consume the response of money movement it creates an &ldquo;out-of-sync&rdquo; transaction. Additionally, incorrect treatment of API responses by any entity in the chain can lead to &ldquo;out-of-sync&rdquo; transactions.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*pUPbefVJWTQhYk5J08OwsA.png\"/><img/><figcaption>Diagram Depicting Various Entities Payment Must Be Passed Through During The Payment&nbsp;Process</figcaption></figure><h3>Introduction to&nbsp;Solution</h3><p>Measuring transactional integrity across this maze of distributed systems in a timely fashion, and subsequently detecting and responding to any anomalies is a challenge. Using many systems of varying maturity makes it nearly impossible to instantaneously track a transaction through various states in different systems&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;platform, payment gateway, payment processor, etc.&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;at all&nbsp;times.</p><p>One potential solution that comes to mind is to use payment gateway APIs for transaction record comparison. The downside to this approach is that it&rsquo;s harder to scale the comparison between internal transaction stores and the external transaction stores using APIs. In fact, some external entities do not even offer this information via API. Furthermore, a dedicated comparison system may be needed to execute API calls to the entity for transactional analysis to avoid any potential impact on live traffic, a scenario which most web-services cannot tolerate.</p><h3>Airbnb&rsquo;s Processor Transaction Reporting System</h3><p>Almost all processors and gateways offers transaction reports and details to the merchant via secure file transfer protocol (SFTP). These transaction reports are offered as part of settlement to the merchant within an agreed upon SLA. Typically, merchants reconcile all the money movement on the platform via 3-way reconciliation between platform transaction records, processor settlement files, and bank statements. Airbnb has a dedicated service that imports, extracts and exports every processor file. In detail, the&nbsp;service:</p><ul><li>Imports daily transaction reports from our payment partners to&nbsp;S3,</li><li>Extracts reports into report-specific staging&nbsp;tables,</li><li>Exports these reports in a consistent format.</li></ul><p>Additionally, it has logic to detect duplicate files and avoid repeated processing of the same file. Many processors/gateways offer these reports in CSV format and every entity uses their own vocabulary in the reports. These transaction details are then stored in a datastore and as part of the export they are sent for reconciliation.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*XUyVAZC3gdJcmjxwiuwRXg.png\"/><img/><figcaption>Diagram Depicting Overall TI&nbsp;Pipeline</figcaption></figure><p>Airbnb&rsquo;s system uses a set of scheduled jobs to execute these activities on a dedicated server. While this system does not have access to Airbnb&rsquo;s platform transactions, we are able to use additional tooling to combine these data sources to trace transactions end-to-end.<br/><br/>Snapshots of every database are available in HDFS at regular intervals. This makes it possible to trace a transaction throughout the ecosystem without leaving your network boundary. It additionally means this is an IO bound problem. Big data technologies are well suited for large scale data comparison problems via map-reduce.</p><h3>Comprehensive Solution</h3><p>As a result, we decided to approach this problem in a segmented format, dividing all payment activity into four broad categories&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;payments, refunds, payouts, and returns. Each category has a dedicated hive pipeline to generate transaction-level reports for all transactions, from all payment entities, both internal and external, within the category. This gives the ability to understand trends within and across the categories. By computing a moving average of these combined categories we&rsquo;re able to produce a single number representing transactional integrity within Airbnb&rsquo;s payment eco-system. This number allows us to measure improvements, detect issues, and set an overall&nbsp;goal.</p><p>With this approach, we are able to trace every transaction at every stage since day zero (the day when Airbnb&rsquo;s Payment Gateway started receiving significant traffic) at regular intervals. Once a normalized view of all the transactions within a category is created, transactions with anomalies can be further grouped based on the type of aberration found. The anomaly attribution can then be directly tied to a business use case such as delayed payouts or mismatched transaction attributes. And because transactions with similar anomalies often require similar remediation of data and/or code fixes, these error groupings help us prioritize our efforts for&nbsp;fixes.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ydFcIIZzM35Qau_xBrDDzw.jpeg\"/><img/><figcaption>Bird&rsquo;s Eye View Transactional Integrity Status</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MSKCtHyyQzyWyoyV7i06xA.png\"/><img/><figcaption>Chart Depicting Categorical Transactional Integrity Status</figcaption></figure><h3>Payment Reconciliation Using Traditional Tools Is Not Sufficient</h3><p>Transactional integrity initiatives differ from the payment reconciliation process in many aspects. Transactional integrity measurements require comparing each and every transaction from day zero (the hypothetically defined start date for a system), while reconciliation often leaves out already matched transactions. Integrity measurement techniques can also be expanded to any number of systems holding transaction records&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;this can include much more than one internal/external system.<br/><br/>Often payment reconciliation is done by matching platform and processor transactions alone. This precludes crucial links where transactional integrity could break down, since it does not offer comparison results for each stage of the process, but only provides an overall picture. Payment reconciliation is done by matching a set of identifying attributes as opposed to executing a deep comparison between two models. Many third party reconciliation technologies we analyzed focused on accounting aspects and provided process management toolkits, but these features don&rsquo;t contribute to transactional integrity directly.<br/><br/>In addition, payment reconciliation is only done when money exchanges hands. However, there are a few transaction types&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;such as voiding an authorization&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;where money never moves, but that still may have an impact on our customers and/or system performance. To maintain a healthy payment system, it&rsquo;s important to compare <em>all</em> types of transactions as opposed to a&nbsp;subset.</p><h3>Big Data Toolkit&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;Hive, Hadoop, HDFS, Airflow And&nbsp;S3</h3><p>Hive has the ability to compare different transaction models represented by different schemas directly with minimal interpretation and without needing any additional integration. This gives us the ability to quickly iterate on the solution.<br/><br/>Hive offers a SQL like interface to query the data, but its biggest strength is to effectively execute map-and-reduce jobs at scale. With this, it&rsquo;s possible to compare each and every transaction throughout the ecosystem on various transaction attributes of interest&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;amount, currency, instrument used, transaction code, status, etc.<br/><br/>Hadoop also offers scalability, with its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce\">MapReduce</a> mechanism that is suited well for comparison between large and growing datasets. HDFS gives us the ability to snapshot transactional integrity at regular intervals to produce a meaningful trend over time. Amazon S3 offers a cost effective datastore for archive purposes and works effectively with our big data toolkit.<br/><br/>Airflow, an Airbnb developed service, offers a scheduling tool to orchestrate data operations, allowing us to execute various steps of intermediate computation and produce a transaction level&nbsp;report.</p><h3><strong>Monitoring Transactional Integrity (Druid, Superset, And Automated Reporting)</strong></h3><p>Dashboards and automated reporting are critical to improve organizational awareness of system issues and to provide tools to measure performance over time. Without clear reporting, it is often difficult and time consuming to identify customer and business impacting events in a timely&nbsp;fashion.</p><p>At Airbnb, we are able to take advantage of an OLAP system built on top of <a href=\"http://druid.io/\">Druid</a>, a low latency, distributed data store, to ingest our transaction pipelines and interactively explore big data in a scalable fashion. Utilizing <a href=\"https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/superset-scaling-data-access-and-visual-insights-at-airbnb-3ce3e9b88a7f\">Superset</a> as a dashboard tool, we are able to display constantly up-to-date measures of health for the entire payment system. With robust payment categorizations built into the our reporting tools, we are able to see the progress of various system issues over time, and in certain cases, these trends help us manage a long tail of historical issues by dealing with them in a scalable&nbsp;way.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2rK47wjWptKM1-V-yVzU0w.png\"/><img/><figcaption>Chart Depicting Anomaly Detection Example</figcaption></figure><p>Anomaly detection is another critical outcome of our transactional integrity projects. Our OLAP system allows us to easily configure anomaly detection algorithms across various dimensional cuts, enabling automatic email/slack notification of any anomalies shortly after our data pipelines land.</p><h3>Key Wins Of Transactional Integrity Analysis</h3><p>Transactional integrity analysis has helped us identify and size issues ranging from simple integration bugs to more nuanced edge-cases around eventual consistency. It has also helped us fine tune various system parameters such as socket timeouts, error handling, and retry mechanisms.</p><p>With the help of transactional integrity data and auxiliary tools, it is easier to proactively synchronize out-of-sync transactions before they impact our community. This has not only dramatically cut down high-volume, low-complexity support tickets, but it has led to large improvements in payment reconciliation, leading to more accurate financial reporting and streamlined operations.<br/><br/>Deep data analysis has also helped us easily monitor and understand processor issues and misbehavior. And building robust alerting on top of our analytical frameworks has enabled our system to proactively notify us about processor outages in online transaction processing or missing/out-of-SLA transaction reports.</p><h3>Future Looking</h3><p>While we have made much progress monitoring and improving our transactional integrity figures to date, there is still much work to be completed in the future to achieve unblemished transactional integrity.</p><p>Today at Airbnb, our system is designed to achieve &ldquo;eventual consistency&rdquo; through automatic retries of failed transactions. Retries address cases where our system does not hear back from downstream processing entities within allowed timeframe due to timeouts, transient system issues, loss of network connectivity, outages, etc. This gives our system the ability to get back &ldquo;in-sync&rdquo; with our processing partners.</p><p>However, safely retrying a payment request requires a strong idempotence guarantee to execute one and only one money movement, which is hard to achieve for every possible use case. With transactional integrity analysis, we have gained insight on how to deal with various edge-case scenarios that break our idempotency guarantee, and we are in the middle of redesigning our framework to achieve near perfect idempotency.</p><p>Furthermore, to trace transactions effectively throughout our distributed system, a normalized transaction taxonomy across processors is required. Computation of transactional integrity requires all data to be available in Hive. An event-driven approach can help us address both these problems elegantly, by designing a normalized settlement event schema that each processor record system can use to share its activity. These settlement events can optionally be decorated with gateway information, and can be captured in our data warehouse to allow transactional integrity measurement and analysis. They can also be consumed by our online transaction system, or be streamed into tools that create tickets, offer real-time analysis, and automatically repair underlying transactions to achieve consistency.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re interested in working on the intricacies of a distributed payment system, or adding an additional &ldquo;9&rdquo; to our transactional integrity numbers, which can even require rebuilding certain parts of our payments system, Airbnb is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.airbnb.com/careers/departments/engineering/payments\">hiring</a>!</p><p><em>Big shout out to Lou Kosak for his thought leadership and prototype.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Ever since my <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/7oav51/i_made_a_monad_that_i_havent_seen_before_and_i/\">initial post on this subreddit</a>, and the <a href=\"http://comonad.com/reader/2018/the-state-comonad/\">post by Edward Kmett that dug deeper</a>, I've experimented a lot with the Store monad and State comonad, and I'm now presenting what I've discovered.</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/KingoftheHomeless/store\">Here's a github link to a repo where I've posted and commented my findings.</a> This post is really just a summation of what I've done there.</p><p><strong>Store probably doesn't translate to a monad transformer</strong></p><p>That is, if you keep <code>StoreT s Identity a</code> to be isomorphic to <code>Store s a</code> and keeping its properties during binding.</p><p>No matter what variation I've tried, the result has always broken left and right identity.</p><p>The reason is that you can't avoid mixing in the effects of the \"reading\" part of StoreT when building the stored value (because the value also needs to be wrapped in the monad). This causes <code>a >>= pure</code> not to be equal to <code>a</code>, but rather <code>a</code>, with the effects of <code>peek a mempty</code> to be added to the value.</p><p>I'm sorry if this is confusing, it's very difficult to explain.</p><p>Whatever the case, I believe <code>StoreT s m a</code><em>is</em> a monad when m is a <code>Comonad</code>. I've given a possible instance in my repo at <code>Control.Comonad.Store.Trans</code>.</p><p><strong>Store has simple variations that DO translate into monad transformers</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/7oav51/i_made_a_monad_that_i_havent_seen_before_and_i/ds96viw/\">In a comment to my original post</a>, I suggested a variation to the Store monad:</p><pre><code>data Prescient s a = Prescient (Maybe s -> a) a </code></pre><p>That would be able to indicate whether or not the Prescient was currently reading or writing.</p><p>I've since realized that <code>(Maybe s -> a)</code> is isomorphic to <code>(a, s -> a)</code>, meaning that</p><pre><code>data Prescient s a = Prescient (Maybe s -> a) s ~ data Prescient s a = Prescient s a (s -> a) ~ Product ((,) s) ((->) s) a </code></pre><p>So basically, I rediscovered the functor product of (,) and (->). A monad transformer is thus possible:</p><pre><code>-- Short for Write then Read newtype WtRT s m a = WtRT (Product (WriterT s m) (ReaderT s m) a) </code></pre><p>It still has the interesting properties of Store, and perhaps even better ones. If the Store monad has any use, then this probably does too -- perhaps this was previously overlooked?</p><p>It's also possible to generalize this a bit further by changing WriterT to StateT.</p><p><strong>I figured out what <code>Co (State s)</code> is</strong></p><p>It does <em>not</em> translate to the monad on Store. Rather:</p><pre><code>Co (State s) a ~ forall r. (s -> (a -> r, s)) -> r ~ forall r. (s -> a -> r, s -> s) -> r ~ forall r. (s -> a -> r) -> (s -> s) -> r ~ forall r. ((s, a) -> r) -> (s -> s) -> r ~ Yoneda ((->) (s -> s)) (s, a) ~ (s -> s) -> (s, a) </code></pre><p><em>However</em>, this does not bind the same way that <code>ReaderT (s -> s) ((,) s) a</code> does. Rather, it acts like an Update monad.</p><p>I believe I've managed to recreate the corresponding monad in my repo, although I'm not sure; check out <code>Control.Monad.Warp</code>.</p><p><strong>I made a possible Comonad transformer for State</strong></p><p>I'm even less sure about this one than the Monad instance for StoreT, because I have a very poor grip of the comonad laws. Still, check out <code>Control.Comonad.State</code> and give me your thoughts.</p><p>Thank you for your time.</p></div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/King_of_the_Homeless\"> /u/King_of_the_Homeless </a><br/><span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/7qwzn4/an_update_about_the_store_monad_and_state_comonad/\">[link]</a></span><span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/7qwzn4/an_update_about_the_store_monad_and_state_comonad/\">[comments]</a></span>"

It was an easy decision to make for my older son because heâd learned to read very early and was well ahead of what we could expect from the local public school. It was an easy decision to make for my younger son due to his extreme social anxiety when he was little (itâs gotten better, thanks for asking).</p>\n<p>They both went to a local public preschool when they were 3 and 4 for a few hours a week, so they both have some experience with public school. My older son also went to public school for first grade. They have respectfully requested that they never be required to go back. My older son will be attending an Atlanta private academy made just for homeschoolers two days a week this semester and heâs excited about that, but itâs small and individualized and so it gives him just enough socializing without cutting too much into the time he wants to spend, oh, doing dangerous chemistry experiments, for example.</p>\n<p>I do work basically full time now, from home, and we somehow keep making it work. I believe this is the result of me guiding them toward becoming independent learners early, so that as soon as both of them could read independently, I donât have to hover over them âteachingâ all day. Itâs a good thing for all of us, as far as I can tell.</p>\n<p>However, a lot of my philosophy of school is premised on my kids having a lot of open-ended discussions with me (mainly me). My younger kid isnât very talkative, while my older one is extremely talkative, so thatâs taken different shapes for different kids. The important goal is to keep them curious, engaged, reasoning, trying to articulate difficult things (including their feelings about things), to whatever extent is appropriate for their age and personality while always gently pushing them (very gently) to extend themselves. I often answer questions with questions about what they think and just guide them to use what they know to find an answer. It takes a lot of patience, time, and trust â your kids have to trust you not to get angry, shut them down, laugh at their reasoning. Most kids have a ton of reasons not to trust their parents and, therefore, not to engage in these kinds of conversations with them. I started preparing for teaching them this way when they were babies, basically, developing this trust, particularly that they could trust me when they made mistakes or felt namelessly frustrated by something.</p>\n<p>Anyway, so I get a lot of questions about how I did it, what books and resources Iâve used to guide me, what books and resources Iâve used with them. So I thought Iâd just put that information here, for reference. I can update periodically as we discover new things or I remember something else we used that Iâd forgotten. My priorities tend to be with making things as enjoyable (with some subjects, itâs really about pain minimization rather than actual enjoyment) as possible for the kids and guiding them toward becoming independent learners. Since I started working again a few years ago, Iâve also had to emphasize materials that require little in the way of advanced preparation from me, but the things we did more of when they were littler and I was working much less required huge inputs of prep time from me.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Many of the recommendations below, by the way, would make excellent donations to libraries, Toys for Tots, book drives, and the like, because education shouldnât be unequally distributed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1 id=\"books-for-parents-or-teachers\">Books for Parents or Teachers</h1>\n<p>Although I was a trained and experienced teacher before I ever had kids, none of that experience or training was in early childhood education, so I still had a lot to learn. Here are things I read that I feel I learned from and that influenced how Iâve approached teaching them:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Tending-Heart-Virtue-Classic-Imagination/dp/0195152646/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516220504&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=tending+the+heart+of+virtue\">Tending the Heart of Virtue</a> by Vigen Gurolan</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Well-Trained-Mind-Classical-Education-Fourth/dp/0393253627/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516220622&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+well+trained+mind\">The Well-Trained Mind</a> by Susan Wise Bauer â Ms.Â Bauer produces a lot of the books we have used in homeschooling over the years. We have used her history books, although now we typically learn history from other books and only buy <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Story-World-Activity-Book-Earliest/dp/1933339055/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516220728&amp;sr=1-5&amp;keywords=susan+wise+bauer+history+of+the+ancient+world\">her supplemental activity books for history</a>, as they have arts and crafts and cooking projects to help make history more fun and real to kids. There are other books that serve a similar purpose, such as the âHands-On Historyâ series, and weâve used some of those, too.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Discovery-Child-Maria-Montessori/dp/0345336569/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516220893&amp;sr=1-5&amp;keywords=maria+montessori\">The Discovery of the Child</a>(and many other books) by Maria Montessori</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Raising-Cain-Protecting-Emotional-Life/dp/0345434854/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516220971&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+emotional+life+of+boys\">Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys</a> by Dan Kindlon and Michael Thompson â I really felt like this book was important to understanding my sons. I do not know of a similar book about the emotional life of girls, but I hope there is one.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://project-based-homeschooling.com/camp-creek-blog\">Project-Based Homeschooling</a> by Lori Pickert, an ongoing source of inspiration.</p>\n<p>The entire philosophies behind</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://naturalmath.com/\">Natural Math</a>. See especially Bright, Brave, Open Minds; Moebius Noodles; and Avoid Hard Work!. They also sometimes offer courses â sometimes they meet online, sometimes they are just a packet of guided materials for you and your kid to work through at your own pace â and I highly recommend these. I wrote about <a href=\"/posts/2016-08-21-kids-logic-class.html\">our experiences with them</a> before.</p></li>\n<li><p>the <a href=\"http://greatbooksacademy.org/\">Great Books Academy</a>. This is where Iâve gotten part of my reading lists for my kids, although they seem to be making the lists harder to access so I may need to start keeping my own. I also have added, e.g., contemporary fiction that I know to be excellent and worth reading and more in line with my kidsâ interests and/or to match up with something weâre learning in history at the time. But kids <em>can</em> enjoy classic literature, unabridged and unadulterated, if they learn to read well.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://csunplugged.org/\">CS Unplugged</a>. I want to teach my kids how to think about computation; thatâs important. Itâs not really important that they learn any particular programming language or set of contemporary computing tools. God willing, they will have access to tools that we havenât even dreamed of yet. I also give my older son (the young one is still a little too young for them) the <a href=\"https://shop.bubblesort.io/\">BubbleSort zines</a> and strongly recommend them.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"books-for-kids\">Books for Kids</h1>\n<p>What you read to them â indeed, what media you bring into the house, thus giving tacit endorsement to â matters so much. I aimed to find books and resources that would feed their curiosity and imagination in ways that would lead them to want to know more, learn more, think about things more.</p>\n<h2 id=\"math-and-reasoning\">Math and Reasoning</h2>\n<p>We do a lot of crossover with math and art because it helps kids visualize what theyâre thinking about mathematically â visualize and make real. There are maths that donât translate easily or well to this, of course, but Iâd encourage you to do it as often as you can.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://naturalmath.com/moebius-noodles/\">Moebius Noodles</a> by Marina Kopylova. Appropriate for toddlers (maybe even earlier), still fun for older kids. This has been a very important book for us. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Annos-Math-Games-Mitsumasa-Anno/dp/0399211519/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516223657&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=anno%27s+math+games\">Annoâs Math Games</a> is in a similar vein.</p>\n<p>The whole <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_fb_1_8?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=sir+cumference+series&amp;sprefix=sir+cumf%2Csports-and-fitness%2C317&amp;crid=1QNLSX38T9BUK\">Sir Cumference and the Dragon of Pi series</a> by Cindy Neuschwander. This has some of the best and most understandable explanations of math concepts for very young children that I have seen, and theyâre fun to read.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.stenhouse.com/content/which-one-doesnt-belong\">Which One Doesnât Belong</a> by Christopher Danielson. See also <a href=\"http://wodb.ca/\">this site which builds on the idea</a>. These lead to great discussions that lead your kids to verbalize their reasoning processes and are so good at teaching them that, sometimes, there isnât <em>one</em> correct way to solve a problem. My kids have never been afraid of math, and I think things like this are a big part of why. <a href=\"https://naturalmath.com/socksarelikepants/\">Socks are like Pants, Cats are like Dogs</a> by Malke Rosenfeld and Gordon Hamilton is along similar lines and also good.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Math-Art-Fun-Multitude-Mathematics/dp/1933979895/ref=sr_1_14?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516222881&amp;sr=8-14&amp;keywords=math+%2B+art\">Math + Art = Fun</a> by Robin A. Ward. This is also good to use in conjunction with trips to art museums. Like, you might not see the exact art works that are in the book, but you can use the mindset to talk to your kids about art.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Greg-Tang/e/B001ILFO4W/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_2?qid=1516221973&amp;sr=8-2\">Greg Tang books and games</a>. Kakooma is wonderful, especially.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://naturalmath.com/camplogic/\">Camp Logic</a> by Mark Saul and Sian Zelbo. This book is fantastic at teaching kids about logic and reasoning skills. It is extremely important to help kids talk through reasoning processes, even if they got the wrong answer. Itâs by finding where they went wrong in reasoning that they learn to get the right answer.</p>\n<p>The ultimate boss of logic, Raymond Smullyan, wrote several books of puzzles that are quite appropriate to talk through with kids (probably not before theyâre 8 or so, though). We started with <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Alice-Puzzle-Land-Carrollian-Children-Recreational/dp/0486482006/ref=pd_sim_14_3?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=0486482006&amp;pd_rd_r=EBV048Z4JXQYQPQKHMJQ&amp;pd_rd_w=m3Mxm&amp;pd_rd_wg=9762J&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=EBV048Z4JXQYQPQKHMJQ\">Alice in Puzzle-land</a>. We very often have my older son read the puzzle aloud while Iâm driving and then the there of us talk it through. Itâs a fantastic way to kill driving time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nostarch.com/laurenipsum\">Lauren Ipsum</a> by Carlos Bueno. My kids loved this and itâs a very fun way to introduce computer science topics. We read it at bedtime (a chapter per night or something) and it kept the kids up late trying to figure it all out. Great fun; weâre planning to re-read it later this year.</p>\n<p>Good read-aloud story books for early math:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/One-Grain-Rice-Mathematical-Folktale/dp/059093998X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516223705&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=demi+the+rice\">One Grain of Rice</a> by Demi.

This book is just so fun to read and, while itâs ridiculous in places, itâs so fun to talk to your kids about some of the more absurd âmath questionsâ.

You can search around for ideas for something related to what your kids are learning. I will be honest here: I mostly shy away from sites oriented toward âfunâ activities for public school teachers, because they have a different goal in teaching than I do.</p>\n<p>If you really want to teach them a programming language and tool and <em>also</em> teach them math, I definitely recommend Chris Smithâs <a href=\"https://code.world/\">codeworld</a>. Itâs a subset of Haskell in an accessible playground, and heâs put a lot of work into developing it into a useful tool for teaching kids math through programming.</p>\n<p>Nowadays my kids go through the Khan Academyâs math video courses for their grade levels and supplement a couple of times a week with practice on <a href=\"https://www.frontrowed.com/\">Front Row</a>, too.</p>\n<p>I did have my kids memorize multiplication tables, because reasoning has mental cost that is wasted if you have to reason through how to multiply 9 by 9 each time you do it, while as far as we can tell there arenât any drawbacks in mental ability to memorizing. It can be a drag if thatâs the only way you teach math, but itâs not for us because we only view memorizing as a way to do this particular thing more efficiently to free up mental space for reasoning about more interesting things. Itâs very similar to the ways in which jargon is information compression.</p>\n<h2 id=\"science-and-nature\">Science and nature</h2>\n<p>While there are some very fine <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Science-Simple-Over-Activities-Preschoolers/dp/0876592728/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516225934&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=science+is+simple\">textbook-like books about science</a> for little kids (and you should, if you are able, equip your budding scientists with <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Learning-Resources-Primary-Science-Activity/dp/B0035EQDTU/ref=sr_1_5?s=toys-and-games&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516224121&amp;sr=1-5&amp;keywords=preschool+science+kit\">science sets</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Insect-Lore-Live-Butterfly-Growing/dp/B00WE1BKDY/ref=sr_1_2?s=toys-and-games&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516224159&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=butterfly+grow+kit\">bug study devices</a>, and beginner microscopes), I want to focus here on books you might not think of as science education materials but really are.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Experiments-That-Failed-Jenny-Offill/dp/0375847626/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516224627&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=11+experiments+that+failed\">11 Experiments that Failed</a> by Jenny Offill. Seriously, this is how I taught my kids about how to run experiments and keep track of what your hypothesis, conditions, and conclusions were.</p>\n<p>For various ages, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Steve-Jenkins/e/B001H6O27S/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1?qid=1516224810&amp;sr=1-1\">all the books by Steve Jenkins</a>. These books are incredible; we love them all. My kidsâ favorites of these have varied at different ages, but definitely Bones; the Actual Size books; and Living Color have been long-time favorites. Also, Just a Second is such a cool exploration of units of time, and What Do You Do With a Tail Like That? is great fun for bedtime story time.</p>\n<p>For various ages, but especially preschool to about 2nd grade, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Nicola-Davies/e/B001IQWM1A/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1?qid=1516224868&amp;sr=8-1\">books by Nicola Davies</a>. My kidsâ favorites were White Owl, Barn Owl; Bat Loves the Night; and Poop. Poop is a very wonderful book. Related: my kids love <a href=\"https://garydrobson.com/books/who-pooped/\">Who Pooped In the Park?</a> by Gary Robson an absolutely obnoxious amount. Talking about poop is just really great with little kids because they are totally fascinated by it (ok, possibly not all children are, I donât know).</p>\n<p>For preschoolers especially, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dianna-Hutts-Aston/e/B001HD0AIG/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1?qid=1516224706&amp;sr=1-1\">all the books by Dianna Hutts Aston</a>. They are beautiful, calming, yet fascinating. My own kidsâ favorites were An Egg is Quiet and A Rock is Lively. Because, hey, rocks and eggs are cool as heck.</p>\n<p>Also check out the <a href=\"http://www.theyoungscientistsclub.com/themagicschoolbus/\">Magic School Bus subscription science kits</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.kiwico.com/tinker\">Tinker Crates</a> for older kids. I will never forget the time, thanks to the Magic School Bus kits, we had petri dishes of toe fungus growing all over the laundry room, and neither will your kids.</p>\n<p>If youâre not familiar with <a href=\"https://www.elenco.com/\">Snap Circuits</a> already, I can also highly recommend those. Younger kids might not read the booklets to learn about the circuits on their own, but if you do the activities with them, you can and then talk about it with them while you do it. The same company also makes beginner soldering kits that are great fun; my older son built <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Elenco-FM-88K-FM-Radio-Kit/dp/B004YHZE0G/ref=pd_bxgy_21_2?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=B004YHZE0G&amp;pd_rd_r=J986WD5N0RDTTN4MBFQM&amp;pd_rd_w=Wg807&amp;pd_rd_wg=qcO0D&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=J986WD5N0RDTTN4MBFQM\">this radio</a> and itâs very cool. The instructions are good, but adult supervision is needed when they have, yknow, a soldering iron.</p>\n<p>Oh, I wasnât aware of these until later than I wished I was, so let me add this: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Dtoys-and-games&amp;field-keywords=knex+simple+machines\">KâNex makes some kits</a> oriented towards teaching about simple machines and geometry and those have been <em>so great</em>.</p>\n<p>Finally, the science list would not be complete without mention of They Might Be Giantsâ <a href=\"https://www.theymightbegiants.com/here-comes-science/\">Here Comes Science</a> CD/video. The videos are great, so if you can get those (I think they are mostly available on YouTube now), do it. Your kids will be singing about the elements and how their circulatory system works in no time at all, and the pair of songs about the sun is a great example of how we used to think one thing (the sun is a mass of incandescent gas) but now weâve had to revise that a bit (the sun is a miasma of incandescent plasma). There are a couple of songs on it that we donât care for a great deal, but thatâs ok.</p>\n<h2 id=\"humanities\">Humanities</h2>\n<p>This is a very broad topic, and I donât necessarily have great answers about some of them.</p>\n<p>I mentioned history above, but we havenât been very happy with any of our particular history courses. My kids have been very disgruntled that so many of them are just litanies of kings and wars and dates, and I agree that I also do not find that type of history study very enjoyable. We really enjoyed one of The Great Courses called <a href=\"https://www.audible.com/pd/History/The-Medieval-World-Audiobook/B00DDU3ALA\">The Medieval World</a> narrated by Professor Dorsey Armstrong because it talks so much about the daily life, culture, music, and food of the medieval world rather than just whoever was the king or whatever at the time. But these are hit or miss (and, yeah, theyâre meant for adults so there are sometimes references to adult topics, although in my experience, these are kept factual and not graphic â her talking about The Canterbury Tales was the most bawdy part of that course, I think).</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Zen-Ties-Jon-J-Muth/dp/0439634253/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8\">Zen Ties</a> series and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Jon-J.-Muth/e/B001H6UCHW/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1\">other books by Jon J. Muth</a>. These books are gorgeous and absolutely fantastic for talking with kids about ethics and the meaning of life. I canât recommend them highly enough.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Cookies-Bite-Size-Amy-Krouse-Rosenthal/dp/006058081X/ref=sr_1_sc_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516226052&amp;sr=1-1-spell&amp;keywords=cookies+by+amy+rosen\">Cookies</a> by Amy Krouse Rosenthal.

These are geared for maximum independent cooking by preschoolers and up (I think Honest Pretzels is aimed at grade schoolers). The recipes require very little adult help because they are written twice: once in words and once entirely in illustrations so even kids with limited reading skills can figure them out. My kids have greatly enjoyed cooking from these books. My older son is now moving up to a Mark Bittman cookbook, and they are responsible for cooking dinner at least once a week.</p>\n<p>Jon Scieskaâs <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Knights-Kitchen-Table-Time-Warp/dp/0142400432/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516226275&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=time+warp+trio\">Time Warp Trio</a> series are good for readers who are ready for chapter books slightly more difficult than Magic Tree House. My sons found them very engaging and they often corresponded to history lessons we were having. The same author has a series called Guys Read that are collected short stories and nonfiction aimed at boys that my boys both love. Oh, and he also wrote one of the greatest, most ridiculous read-aloud books of all time, The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Stories. I still canât get through the Stinky Cheese Man story without laughing out loud, despite many readings.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Kids-Questions-Wonder-Everything/dp/1882664701/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516225587&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=philosophy+for+kids\">Philosophy for Kids</a> by David A. White. I think this book has some flaws but so far itâs the best one Iâve found for talking with kids about philosophical questions. Not everyone will prefer teaching their kids that there is a great deal of debate about what constitutes ârightâ and âwrongâ or âjusticeâ but for those of us who do, this book is an approachable starting point.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/How-Artists-See-6-Collection/dp/0789209624/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516222743&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=how+artists+see\">How Artists See</a>(series) by Colleen Carroll.

They are abridged to be more appropriate for kids, but without being âdumbed downâ or diminished.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Donna-Jo-Napoli/e/B000APXY12/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1?qid=1516227224&amp;sr=1-1\">anthologies of mythology</a> that Donna Jo Napoli and Christina Balit have been doing are also so good. We have several. My older son loves especially The Arabian Nights; my younger sonâs favorite is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Atlantis-Legend-Lost-Christina-Balit/dp/080506334X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516227303&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=atlantis+christina+balit\">Atlantis</a> which, oh, I guess itâs only by Christina Balit.</p>\n<p>I might make more reading lists of great books-ish fiction for various ages, as I have often felt like it was difficult to come up with ideas for what my kids should be reading next.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-hated-subjects\">The Hated Subjects</h2>\n<p>(for my kids at least)</p>\n<h3 id=\"grammar\">Grammar</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Wanda-C.-Phillips/e/B001KCPFPW/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1?qid=1516227364&amp;sr=1-1\">Easy Grammar by Wanda C. Phillips</a>. By far the least painful and most effective method weâve found. Each lesson is short and to the point, and I think her method of starting from prepositions is brilliant. You can get right to the heart of a sentence so quickly by breaking it down as subject plus verb plus prepositional phrases.</p>\n<h3 id=\"writing\">Writing</h3>\n<p>Handwriting Without Tears. Again, it just fits the bill for short, focused lessons that are also systematic enough that kids learn with a minimum of struggle. Both of my boys hated handwriting practice but donât mind these books. I make them learn cursive, too, because I think itâs good for them, and it allows them to read letters from their great-grandmother, which is not a bad thing at all.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/First-Language-Lessons-Well-Trained-Mind/dp/1933339446/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516227804&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=first+language+lessons+level+1\">First Language Lessons</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Writer-Level-Workbook-Writing/dp/1933339268/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516227859&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=writing+with+ease\">Writing with Ease</a> by Susan Wise Bauer again. My boys also hate writing exercises. In fact, my older son hated this more than anything when he was in public school, and I couldnât understand why. He loves to read, and he always has stuff to say. So I backed up to what classical education teaches us about this: that many children need to practice the plain mechanics of putting words in sentences and paragraphs on paper, and also fill their heads with great words and ideas, before they may feel comfortable writing independently. Writing lessons went, for us, from the absolute worst part of the day to â¦ tolerable. This is tolerable for the children, and they are making great progress, progress they made under no other system. Yes, we do copybook and dictation exercises. They are short. Itâs like when you tell yourself you can go to the gym for just 15 minutes so that makes it seem tolerable and then you find yourself actually exercising for half an hour or whatever. These books are like that for my sons. I also extremely appreciate that, if you buy the workbooks, this requires very little in the way of daily preparation for me, the busy mom-teacher.</p>\n<p>Oxford Book of American Childrenâs Poems, although other books of classic childrenâs poetry would work fine. We memorize poetry. What does this have to do with writing, you ask? And why even do it?</p>\n<p>One of the hard things about learning to write well is learning what âwellâ means. Filling your head with words and sentence structures you love helps so much toward that end. I was really doubtful of how well my kids would take to this before we started, but they love it. They love being out in the forest for a hike and hearing birds chattering and then all three of us, as a family, start reciting <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=10h5edHD4VkC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;dq=elizabeth+coatsworth+no+shop+does&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=O0jvvyhKgJ&amp;sig=Mxdek9Og1dzSnfxL5sp46FPQhhg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj885PeheDYAhUBUK0KHRfjBCYQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=elizabeth%20coatsworth%20no%20shop%20does&amp;f=false\">No Shop Does the Bird Use</a> by Elizabeth Coatsworth.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reading-skills\">Reading skills</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Teach-Your-Child-Read-Lessons/dp/0671631985/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516217266&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=reading+phonics+preschoolers\">Teach your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons</a> â To be quite honest, I did not believe this book and method would work, but it did, wonderfully. It made teaching the kids to read so painless. I really had no idea how you go about teaching kids to read and was so grateful to find this book.</p>\n<p>Listen to audiobooks with your kids, too, and talk about them with them. Itâs a great way to spend driving time. Most recently, my kids loved Tim Curryâs performance of A Christmas Carol and have asked that listening to it every year be incorporated into our Christmas traditions.</p>\n<p>Once they can read, the important thing for a while is to make sure theyâre practicing, which will be easiest if you keep books around that are a) level-appropriate (basically, their level plus just a smidgen more challenging â too challenging and they will get frustrated; too easy and they will not improve) and b) they enjoy. My older son loved Magic Tree House books; my younger son dislikes them very strongly but loves loves loves all the Roald Dahl books. Both of these suit the purposes of giving a 7-8 year old child the right balance between just challenging enough and enjoyment. (In general, and I know this is unpopular, but I advise against letting your kids read trash. We all know there are trash books out there â formulaic plots, wooden characters, dialogue that seriously no one would ever say this â and letting your kids read them exclusively is like only feeding them potato chips. Potato chips are fine sometimes; theyâre not fine as your only diet.)</p>\n<p>As their reading skills and confidence increase, you need to keep slightly increasing the difficulty. Never force your kid to finish a book they hate. Try to talk calmly with them about why they hate it; try to get them to articulate it. Let them know itâs ok to hate it, even if the reason they hate it is because itâs too hard for them right now. That is totally legit.</p>\n<p>I do not take the unschooling approach of not telling my kids what to read. I want them to experience genres they wouldnât have otherwise considered reading. My older son didnât want to read Little House on the Prairie or Charlotteâs Web at first, because he thought they were âgirlâ books; he ended up loving both of them and went on to read the entire Little House series on his own. Itâs legit to start reading a book and find itâs genuinely not for you, although, again, you should try to get your kids to articulate why (not in a confrontational spirit, but because itâs good for their verbal reasoning skills to do this). I hated The Wind in the Willows and also Little Women; my older son has read both and was relieved to find that Iâd hated them as much as he did, but we were able to talk about why. However, he likes Dickens and I donât, and, again, we talk about why.</p>\n<p>A final thing: both of my kids expressed fear as they grew increasingly able to read on their own that I would stop reading to them at night and so we would lose that special time and shared conversation. I suspect a lot of kids actually have this fear and wonât express it or perhaps donât even realize it (it took a lot of gentle conversation before my kids told me). So, they are 8 and 12 now and we still read together every night. We have read the entire Bunnicula series, the entire Series of Unfortunate Events series, the entire His Dark Materials series. I love it; they love it. Consider relieving your kidsâ anxiety by showing that you enjoy sharing this with them (your kids may, of course, be different than mine, but donât assume they donât have this anxiety just because you didnât).</p>\n<h1 id=\"field-trips-and-fun\">Field trips and fun</h1>\n<p>From the youngest ages, I have taken my kids to museums and aquariums and national parks just as often as we can. They often have free days for families or whatever (we used to be extremely poor, well below poverty line, so Iâm very aware these can be hard to afford), so you can always try to schedule accordingly.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>At National Parks and Monuments, ask for the Junior Ranger packets even if your kids are too young to fill them out by themselves. Use it to talk to them about things youâre seeing, about the history and geography and wildlife of the place.</li>\n<li>Art museums and many history museums also have packets (sometimes things you can take with you, sometimes things you have to return) to guide kids through the exhibits. The <a href=\"http://www.theartmuseum.org/\">Art Museum of Eastern Idaho</a> used to have these great ones that even asked the kids to try to draw copies of some of the art work. They also had a large play area for kids full of exploratory toys, many of which we couldnât even have afforded or made room for in our house. My kids loved it there. The <a href=\"http://www.boiseartmuseum.org/\">Boise Art Museum</a> has very thorough packets for each exhibit that ask a lot of great open-ended questions that encourage discussion and real engagement with the artwork. Weâre finding the Atlanta area museums and attractions also offer a great number of such services, and weâre delighted by it. One reason we moved here is how great a place it is for homeschoolers.</li>\n<li>Get a nature journal of some kind. When your kids are really little, you can write down their observations for them; as they get older, encourage them to keep their own, even if much of it is drawings. Encourage them to notice the seasonal changes, what wildlife the park attracts (even urban parks often have some). Get them a pack of travel colored pencils or whatever drawing tool they like and take it in a backpack with some binoculars each time you have time to take them to a park â even if you only spend 15 minutes or so a week, or even every couple of weeks, doing this. It has led to some of my childrenâs very happiest memories, and some of my very happiest memories of them.</li>\n<li>If you can, even in a windowbox or a single planter on the patio, take up gardening with your kids. Even better, take up foraging (this is harder to do than gardening, though, but Iâve done it even in somewhat urban areas) which will encourage them (and you) to be very aware of their surroundings and to learn more about the plants they see everyday. Gardening can be high or low commitment, but itâs so good for kids to learn where food comes from because itâs so easy for them to engage with food. And then it can lead to conversations about food chains, ecosystems, worms (big fun) and compost, so many things.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also play a lot of games as a family. There are a ton of great ones available for math skills, and the Cranium types of games for various skill building. My kids really loved <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Hi-Cherry-Game-Amazon-Exclusive/dp/B00000IWGQ/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516228239&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=kids+game+cherry\">Hi Ho Cherry-O</a> for early addition skills, and now we play <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Math-for-Love-Prime-Climb/dp/B00PG9590G/ref=sr_1_2?rps=1&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516228290&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=prime+climb\">Prime Climb</a> for a little more advanced arithmetic. When they were little, we played a lot of <a href=\"http://www.lucybingogames.com/\">reptile and bug bingo</a> and (somewhat tediously to the adult) read the information on the backs of each card as we played.</p>\n<p>I donât know about game recommendations, though. Iâm not sure it matters so much what game youâre playing as that youâre playing with your kids. My older son loves chess and cribbage and nearly all other card games. My younger son is much more picky and used to refuse to play games at all, so it took a while to find ones heâd play with us. He really loves this <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Smithsonian-Mission-Museum-Missing-Mummy/dp/B005JAM540/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516228544&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=smithsonian+case+of+the+missing+mummy\">Case of the Missing Mummy</a> game. They have a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Think-Fun-7090-ThinkFun-Knot/dp/B0032UP5R8/ref=sr_1_1?s=toys-and-games&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516228800&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=knot+game\">knotting game</a> they both enjoy, except the younger one is often upset that his older brother can beat him pretty handily at it.</p>",

It was an easy decision to make for my older son because he&acirc;&#128;&#153;d learned to read very early and was well ahead of what we could expect from the local public school. It was an easy decision to make for my younger son due to his extreme social anxiety when he was little (it&acirc;&#128;&#153;s gotten better, thanks for asking).</p><p>They both went to a local public preschool when they were 3 and 4 for a few hours a week, so they both have some experience with public school. My older son also went to public school for first grade. They have respectfully requested that they never be required to go back. My older son will be attending an Atlanta private academy made just for homeschoolers two days a week this semester and he&acirc;&#128;&#153;s excited about that, but it&acirc;&#128;&#153;s small and individualized and so it gives him just enough socializing without cutting too much into the time he wants to spend, oh, doing dangerous chemistry experiments, for example.</p><p>I do work basically full time now, from home, and we somehow keep making it work. I believe this is the result of me guiding them toward becoming independent learners early, so that as soon as both of them could read independently, I don&acirc;&#128;&#153;t have to hover over them &acirc;&#128;&#156;teaching&acirc;&#128;&#157; all day. It&acirc;&#128;&#153;s a good thing for all of us, as far as I can tell.</p><p>However, a lot of my philosophy of school is premised on my kids having a lot of open-ended discussions with me (mainly me). My younger kid isn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t very talkative, while my older one is extremely talkative, so that&acirc;&#128;&#153;s taken different shapes for different kids. The important goal is to keep them curious, engaged, reasoning, trying to articulate difficult things (including their feelings about things), to whatever extent is appropriate for their age and personality while always gently pushing them (very gently) to extend themselves. I often answer questions with questions about what they think and just guide them to use what they know to find an answer. It takes a lot of patience, time, and trust &acirc;&#128;&#147; your kids have to trust you not to get angry, shut them down, laugh at their reasoning. Most kids have a ton of reasons not to trust their parents and, therefore, not to engage in these kinds of conversations with them. I started preparing for teaching them this way when they were babies, basically, developing this trust, particularly that they could trust me when they made mistakes or felt namelessly frustrated by something.</p><p>Anyway, so I get a lot of questions about how I did it, what books and resources I&acirc;&#128;&#153;ve used to guide me, what books and resources I&acirc;&#128;&#153;ve used with them. So I thought I&acirc;&#128;&#153;d just put that information here, for reference. I can update periodically as we discover new things or I remember something else we used that I&acirc;&#128;&#153;d forgotten. My priorities tend to be with making things as enjoyable (with some subjects, it&acirc;&#128;&#153;s really about pain minimization rather than actual enjoyment) as possible for the kids and guiding them toward becoming independent learners. Since I started working again a few years ago, I&acirc;&#128;&#153;ve also had to emphasize materials that require little in the way of advanced preparation from me, but the things we did more of when they were littler and I was working much less required huge inputs of prep time from me.</p><blockquote><p>Many of the recommendations below, by the way, would make excellent donations to libraries, Toys for Tots, book drives, and the like, because education shouldn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t be unequally distributed.</p></blockquote><h1 id=\"books-for-parents-or-teachers\">Books for Parents or Teachers</h1><p>Although I was a trained and experienced teacher before I ever had kids, none of that experience or training was in early childhood education, so I still had a lot to learn. Here are things I read that I feel I learned from and that influenced how I&acirc;&#128;&#153;ve approached teaching them:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Tending-Heart-Virtue-Classic-Imagination/dp/0195152646/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516220504&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=tending+the+heart+of+virtue\">Tending the Heart of Virtue</a> by Vigen Gurolan</p><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Well-Trained-Mind-Classical-Education-Fourth/dp/0393253627/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516220622&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+well+trained+mind\">The Well-Trained Mind</a> by Susan Wise Bauer &acirc;&#128;&#147; Ms.&Acirc;&nbsp;Bauer produces a lot of the books we have used in homeschooling over the years. We have used her history books, although now we typically learn history from other books and only buy <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Story-World-Activity-Book-Earliest/dp/1933339055/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516220728&amp;sr=1-5&amp;keywords=susan+wise+bauer+history+of+the+ancient+world\">her supplemental activity books for history</a>, as they have arts and crafts and cooking projects to help make history more fun and real to kids. There are other books that serve a similar purpose, such as the &acirc;&#128;&#156;Hands-On History&acirc;&#128;&#157; series, and we&acirc;&#128;&#153;ve used some of those, too.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Discovery-Child-Maria-Montessori/dp/0345336569/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516220893&amp;sr=1-5&amp;keywords=maria+montessori\">The Discovery of the Child</a>(and many other books) by Maria Montessori</p><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Raising-Cain-Protecting-Emotional-Life/dp/0345434854/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516220971&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+emotional+life+of+boys\">Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys</a> by Dan Kindlon and Michael Thompson &acirc;&#128;&#147; I really felt like this book was important to understanding my sons. I do not know of a similar book about the emotional life of girls, but I hope there is one.</p><p><a href=\"http://project-based-homeschooling.com/camp-creek-blog\">Project-Based Homeschooling</a> by Lori Pickert, an ongoing source of inspiration.</p><p>The entire philosophies behind</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://naturalmath.com/\">Natural Math</a>. See especially Bright, Brave, Open Minds; Moebius Noodles; and Avoid Hard Work!. They also sometimes offer courses &acirc;&#128;&#147; sometimes they meet online, sometimes they are just a packet of guided materials for you and your kid to work through at your own pace &acirc;&#128;&#147; and I highly recommend these. I wrote about <a href=\"http://argumatronic.com/posts/2016-08-21-kids-logic-class.html\">our experiences with them</a> before.</p></li><li><p>the <a href=\"http://greatbooksacademy.org/\">Great Books Academy</a>. This is where I&acirc;&#128;&#153;ve gotten part of my reading lists for my kids, although they seem to be making the lists harder to access so I may need to start keeping my own. I also have added, e.g., contemporary fiction that I know to be excellent and worth reading and more in line with my kids&acirc;&#128;&#153; interests and/or to match up with something we&acirc;&#128;&#153;re learning in history at the time. But kids <em>can</em> enjoy classic literature, unabridged and unadulterated, if they learn to read well.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"http://csunplugged.org/\">CS Unplugged</a>. I want to teach my kids how to think about computation; that&acirc;&#128;&#153;s important. It&acirc;&#128;&#153;s not really important that they learn any particular programming language or set of contemporary computing tools. God willing, they will have access to tools that we haven&acirc;&#128;&#153;t even dreamed of yet. I also give my older son (the young one is still a little too young for them) the <a href=\"https://shop.bubblesort.io/\">BubbleSort zines</a> and strongly recommend them.</p></li></ul><h1 id=\"books-for-kids\">Books for Kids</h1><p>What you read to them &acirc;&#128;&#147; indeed, what media you bring into the house, thus giving tacit endorsement to &acirc;&#128;&#147; matters so much. I aimed to find books and resources that would feed their curiosity and imagination in ways that would lead them to want to know more, learn more, think about things more.</p><h2 id=\"math-and-reasoning\">Math and Reasoning</h2><p>We do a lot of crossover with math and art because it helps kids visualize what they&acirc;&#128;&#153;re thinking about mathematically &acirc;&#128;&#147; visualize and make real. There are maths that don&acirc;&#128;&#153;t translate easily or well to this, of course, but I&acirc;&#128;&#153;d encourage you to do it as often as you can.</p><p><a href=\"https://naturalmath.com/moebius-noodles/\">Moebius Noodles</a> by Marina Kopylova. Appropriate for toddlers (maybe even earlier), still fun for older kids. This has been a very important book for us. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Annos-Math-Games-Mitsumasa-Anno/dp/0399211519/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516223657&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=anno%27s+math+games\">Anno&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Math Games</a> is in a similar vein.</p><p>The whole <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_fb_1_8?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=sir+cumference+series&amp;sprefix=sir+cumf%2Csports-and-fitness%2C317&amp;crid=1QNLSX38T9BUK\">Sir Cumference and the Dragon of Pi series</a> by Cindy Neuschwander. This has some of the best and most understandable explanations of math concepts for very young children that I have seen, and they&acirc;&#128;&#153;re fun to read.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.stenhouse.com/content/which-one-doesnt-belong\">Which One Doesn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t Belong</a> by Christopher Danielson. See also <a href=\"http://wodb.ca/\">this site which builds on the idea</a>. These lead to great discussions that lead your kids to verbalize their reasoning processes and are so good at teaching them that, sometimes, there isn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t <em>one</em> correct way to solve a problem. My kids have never been afraid of math, and I think things like this are a big part of why. <a href=\"https://naturalmath.com/socksarelikepants/\">Socks are like Pants, Cats are like Dogs</a> by Malke Rosenfeld and Gordon Hamilton is along similar lines and also good.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Math-Art-Fun-Multitude-Mathematics/dp/1933979895/ref=sr_1_14?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516222881&amp;sr=8-14&amp;keywords=math+%2B+art\">Math + Art = Fun</a> by Robin A. Ward. This is also good to use in conjunction with trips to art museums. Like, you might not see the exact art works that are in the book, but you can use the mindset to talk to your kids about art.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Greg-Tang/e/B001ILFO4W/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_2?qid=1516221973&amp;sr=8-2\">Greg Tang books and games</a>. Kakooma is wonderful, especially.</p><p><a href=\"https://naturalmath.com/camplogic/\">Camp Logic</a> by Mark Saul and Sian Zelbo. This book is fantastic at teaching kids about logic and reasoning skills. It is extremely important to help kids talk through reasoning processes, even if they got the wrong answer. It&acirc;&#128;&#153;s by finding where they went wrong in reasoning that they learn to get the right answer.</p><p>The ultimate boss of logic, Raymond Smullyan, wrote several books of puzzles that are quite appropriate to talk through with kids (probably not before they&acirc;&#128;&#153;re 8 or so, though). We started with <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Alice-Puzzle-Land-Carrollian-Children-Recreational/dp/0486482006/ref=pd_sim_14_3?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=0486482006&amp;pd_rd_r=EBV048Z4JXQYQPQKHMJQ&amp;pd_rd_w=m3Mxm&amp;pd_rd_wg=9762J&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=EBV048Z4JXQYQPQKHMJQ\">Alice in Puzzle-land</a>. We very often have my older son read the puzzle aloud while I&acirc;&#128;&#153;m driving and then the there of us talk it through. It&acirc;&#128;&#153;s a fantastic way to kill driving time.</p><p><a href=\"https://nostarch.com/laurenipsum\">Lauren Ipsum</a> by Carlos Bueno. My kids loved this and it&acirc;&#128;&#153;s a very fun way to introduce computer science topics. We read it at bedtime (a chapter per night or something) and it kept the kids up late trying to figure it all out. Great fun; we&acirc;&#128;&#153;re planning to re-read it later this year.</p><p>Good read-aloud story books for early math:</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/One-Grain-Rice-Mathematical-Folktale/dp/059093998X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516223705&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=demi+the+rice\">One Grain of Rice</a> by Demi. This book is gorgeous, as are all Demi&acirc;&#128;&#153;s books, and will impress your children with the awesome power of doubling.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Math-Curse-Jon-Scieszka/dp/0670861944/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516221504&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=math+curse\">Math Curse</a> by Jon Scieszka. This book is just so fun to read and, while it&acirc;&#128;&#153;s ridiculous in places, it&acirc;&#128;&#153;s so fun to talk to your kids about some of the more absurd &acirc;&#128;&#156;math questions&acirc;&#128;&#157;. We have read it countless times and each time we have a different discussion.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Million-Anniversary-Reading-Rainbow-Books/dp/0688099335/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516223765&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=how+much+is+a+million\">How Much is a Million?</a> by David Schwarz.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Pythagorean-Theorem-Babies-Math/dp/148200058X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516223851&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+pythagorean+theorem+for+babies\">The Pythagorean Theorem for Babies</a> by Fred Carlson. It&acirc;&#128;&#153;s a short, simple, visual proof of the Pythagorean theorem.

You can search around for ideas for something related to what your kids are learning. I will be honest here: I mostly shy away from sites oriented toward &acirc;&#128;&#156;fun&acirc;&#128;&#157; activities for public school teachers, because they have a different goal in teaching than I do.</p><p>If you really want to teach them a programming language and tool and <em>also</em> teach them math, I definitely recommend Chris Smith&acirc;&#128;&#153;s <a href=\"https://code.world/\">codeworld</a>. It&acirc;&#128;&#153;s a subset of Haskell in an accessible playground, and he&acirc;&#128;&#153;s put a lot of work into developing it into a useful tool for teaching kids math through programming.</p><p>Nowadays my kids go through the Khan Academy&acirc;&#128;&#153;s math video courses for their grade levels and supplement a couple of times a week with practice on <a href=\"https://www.frontrowed.com/\">Front Row</a>, too.</p><p>I did have my kids memorize multiplication tables, because reasoning has mental cost that is wasted if you have to reason through how to multiply 9 by 9 each time you do it, while as far as we can tell there aren&acirc;&#128;&#153;t any drawbacks in mental ability to memorizing. It can be a drag if that&acirc;&#128;&#153;s the only way you teach math, but it&acirc;&#128;&#153;s not for us because we only view memorizing as a way to do this particular thing more efficiently to free up mental space for reasoning about more interesting things. It&acirc;&#128;&#153;s very similar to the ways in which jargon is information compression.</p><h2 id=\"science-and-nature\">Science and nature</h2><p>While there are some very fine <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Science-Simple-Over-Activities-Preschoolers/dp/0876592728/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516225934&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=science+is+simple\">textbook-like books about science</a> for little kids (and you should, if you are able, equip your budding scientists with <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Learning-Resources-Primary-Science-Activity/dp/B0035EQDTU/ref=sr_1_5?s=toys-and-games&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516224121&amp;sr=1-5&amp;keywords=preschool+science+kit\">science sets</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Insect-Lore-Live-Butterfly-Growing/dp/B00WE1BKDY/ref=sr_1_2?s=toys-and-games&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516224159&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=butterfly+grow+kit\">bug study devices</a>, and beginner microscopes), I want to focus here on books you might not think of as science education materials but really are.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Experiments-That-Failed-Jenny-Offill/dp/0375847626/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516224627&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=11+experiments+that+failed\">11 Experiments that Failed</a> by Jenny Offill. Seriously, this is how I taught my kids about how to run experiments and keep track of what your hypothesis, conditions, and conclusions were.</p><p>For various ages, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Steve-Jenkins/e/B001H6O27S/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1?qid=1516224810&amp;sr=1-1\">all the books by Steve Jenkins</a>. These books are incredible; we love them all. My kids&acirc;&#128;&#153; favorites of these have varied at different ages, but definitely Bones; the Actual Size books; and Living Color have been long-time favorites. Also, Just a Second is such a cool exploration of units of time, and What Do You Do With a Tail Like That? is great fun for bedtime story time.</p><p>For various ages, but especially preschool to about 2nd grade, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Nicola-Davies/e/B001IQWM1A/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1?qid=1516224868&amp;sr=8-1\">books by Nicola Davies</a>. My kids&acirc;&#128;&#153; favorites were White Owl, Barn Owl; Bat Loves the Night; and Poop. Poop is a very wonderful book. Related: my kids love <a href=\"https://garydrobson.com/books/who-pooped/\">Who Pooped In the Park?</a> by Gary Robson an absolutely obnoxious amount. Talking about poop is just really great with little kids because they are totally fascinated by it (ok, possibly not all children are, I don&acirc;&#128;&#153;t know).</p><p>For preschoolers especially, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dianna-Hutts-Aston/e/B001HD0AIG/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1?qid=1516224706&amp;sr=1-1\">all the books by Dianna Hutts Aston</a>. They are beautiful, calming, yet fascinating. My own kids&acirc;&#128;&#153; favorites were An Egg is Quiet and A Rock is Lively. Because, hey, rocks and eggs are cool as heck.</p><p>Also check out the <a href=\"http://www.theyoungscientistsclub.com/themagicschoolbus/\">Magic School Bus subscription science kits</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.kiwico.com/tinker\">Tinker Crates</a> for older kids. I will never forget the time, thanks to the Magic School Bus kits, we had petri dishes of toe fungus growing all over the laundry room, and neither will your kids.</p><p>If you&acirc;&#128;&#153;re not familiar with <a href=\"https://www.elenco.com/\">Snap Circuits</a> already, I can also highly recommend those. Younger kids might not read the booklets to learn about the circuits on their own, but if you do the activities with them, you can and then talk about it with them while you do it. The same company also makes beginner soldering kits that are great fun; my older son built <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Elenco-FM-88K-FM-Radio-Kit/dp/B004YHZE0G/ref=pd_bxgy_21_2?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=B004YHZE0G&amp;pd_rd_r=J986WD5N0RDTTN4MBFQM&amp;pd_rd_w=Wg807&amp;pd_rd_wg=qcO0D&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=J986WD5N0RDTTN4MBFQM\">this radio</a> and it&acirc;&#128;&#153;s very cool. The instructions are good, but adult supervision is needed when they have, yknow, a soldering iron.</p><p>Oh, I wasn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t aware of these until later than I wished I was, so let me add this: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Dtoys-and-games&amp;field-keywords=knex+simple+machines\">K&acirc;&#128;&#153;Nex makes some kits</a> oriented towards teaching about simple machines and geometry and those have been <em>so great</em>.</p><p>Finally, the science list would not be complete without mention of They Might Be Giants&acirc;&#128;&#153; <a href=\"https://www.theymightbegiants.com/here-comes-science/\">Here Comes Science</a> CD/video. The videos are great, so if you can get those (I think they are mostly available on YouTube now), do it. Your kids will be singing about the elements and how their circulatory system works in no time at all, and the pair of songs about the sun is a great example of how we used to think one thing (the sun is a mass of incandescent gas) but now we&acirc;&#128;&#153;ve had to revise that a bit (the sun is a miasma of incandescent plasma). There are a couple of songs on it that we don&acirc;&#128;&#153;t care for a great deal, but that&acirc;&#128;&#153;s ok.</p><h2 id=\"humanities\">Humanities</h2><p>This is a very broad topic, and I don&acirc;&#128;&#153;t necessarily have great answers about some of them.</p><p>I mentioned history above, but we haven&acirc;&#128;&#153;t been very happy with any of our particular history courses. My kids have been very disgruntled that so many of them are just litanies of kings and wars and dates, and I agree that I also do not find that type of history study very enjoyable. We really enjoyed one of The Great Courses called <a href=\"https://www.audible.com/pd/History/The-Medieval-World-Audiobook/B00DDU3ALA\">The Medieval World</a> narrated by Professor Dorsey Armstrong because it talks so much about the daily life, culture, music, and food of the medieval world rather than just whoever was the king or whatever at the time. But these are hit or miss (and, yeah, they&acirc;&#128;&#153;re meant for adults so there are sometimes references to adult topics, although in my experience, these are kept factual and not graphic &acirc;&#128;&#147; her talking about The Canterbury Tales was the most bawdy part of that course, I think).</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Zen-Ties-Jon-J-Muth/dp/0439634253/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8\">Zen Ties</a> series and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Jon-J.-Muth/e/B001H6UCHW/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1\">other books by Jon J. Muth</a>. These books are gorgeous and absolutely fantastic for talking with kids about ethics and the meaning of life. I can&acirc;&#128;&#153;t recommend them highly enough.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Cookies-Bite-Size-Amy-Krouse-Rosenthal/dp/006058081X/ref=sr_1_sc_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516226052&amp;sr=1-1-spell&amp;keywords=cookies+by+amy+rosen\">Cookies</a> by Amy Krouse Rosenthal.

These are geared for maximum independent cooking by preschoolers and up (I think Honest Pretzels is aimed at grade schoolers). The recipes require very little adult help because they are written twice: once in words and once entirely in illustrations so even kids with limited reading skills can figure them out. My kids have greatly enjoyed cooking from these books. My older son is now moving up to a Mark Bittman cookbook, and they are responsible for cooking dinner at least once a week.</p><p>Jon Scieska&acirc;&#128;&#153;s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Knights-Kitchen-Table-Time-Warp/dp/0142400432/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516226275&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=time+warp+trio\">Time Warp Trio</a> series are good for readers who are ready for chapter books slightly more difficult than Magic Tree House. My sons found them very engaging and they often corresponded to history lessons we were having. The same author has a series called Guys Read that are collected short stories and nonfiction aimed at boys that my boys both love. Oh, and he also wrote one of the greatest, most ridiculous read-aloud books of all time, The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Stories. I still can&acirc;&#128;&#153;t get through the Stinky Cheese Man story without laughing out loud, despite many readings.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Kids-Questions-Wonder-Everything/dp/1882664701/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516225587&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=philosophy+for+kids\">Philosophy for Kids</a> by David A. White. I think this book has some flaws but so far it&acirc;&#128;&#153;s the best one I&acirc;&#128;&#153;ve found for talking with kids about philosophical questions. Not everyone will prefer teaching their kids that there is a great deal of debate about what constitutes &acirc;&#128;&#156;right&acirc;&#128;&#157; and &acirc;&#128;&#156;wrong&acirc;&#128;&#157; or &acirc;&#128;&#156;justice&acirc;&#128;&#157; but for those of us who do, this book is an approachable starting point.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/How-Artists-See-6-Collection/dp/0789209624/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516222743&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=how+artists+see\">How Artists See</a>(series) by Colleen Carroll.

They are abridged to be more appropriate for kids, but without being &acirc;&#128;&#156;dumbed down&acirc;&#128;&#157; or diminished.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Donna-Jo-Napoli/e/B000APXY12/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1?qid=1516227224&amp;sr=1-1\">anthologies of mythology</a> that Donna Jo Napoli and Christina Balit have been doing are also so good. We have several. My older son loves especially The Arabian Nights; my younger son&acirc;&#128;&#153;s favorite is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Atlantis-Legend-Lost-Christina-Balit/dp/080506334X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516227303&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=atlantis+christina+balit\">Atlantis</a> which, oh, I guess it&acirc;&#128;&#153;s only by Christina Balit.</p><p>I might make more reading lists of great books-ish fiction for various ages, as I have often felt like it was difficult to come up with ideas for what my kids should be reading next.</p><h2 id=\"the-hated-subjects\">The Hated Subjects</h2><p>(for my kids at least)</p><h3 id=\"grammar\">Grammar</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Wanda-C.-Phillips/e/B001KCPFPW/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1?qid=1516227364&amp;sr=1-1\">Easy Grammar by Wanda C. Phillips</a>. By far the least painful and most effective method we&acirc;&#128;&#153;ve found. Each lesson is short and to the point, and I think her method of starting from prepositions is brilliant. You can get right to the heart of a sentence so quickly by breaking it down as subject plus verb plus prepositional phrases.</p><h3 id=\"writing\">Writing</h3><p>Handwriting Without Tears. Again, it just fits the bill for short, focused lessons that are also systematic enough that kids learn with a minimum of struggle. Both of my boys hated handwriting practice but don&acirc;&#128;&#153;t mind these books. I make them learn cursive, too, because I think it&acirc;&#128;&#153;s good for them, and it allows them to read letters from their great-grandmother, which is not a bad thing at all.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/First-Language-Lessons-Well-Trained-Mind/dp/1933339446/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516227804&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=first+language+lessons+level+1\">First Language Lessons</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Writer-Level-Workbook-Writing/dp/1933339268/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516227859&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=writing+with+ease\">Writing with Ease</a> by Susan Wise Bauer again. My boys also hate writing exercises. In fact, my older son hated this more than anything when he was in public school, and I couldn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t understand why. He loves to read, and he always has stuff to say. So I backed up to what classical education teaches us about this: that many children need to practice the plain mechanics of putting words in sentences and paragraphs on paper, and also fill their heads with great words and ideas, before they may feel comfortable writing independently. Writing lessons went, for us, from the absolute worst part of the day to &acirc;&#128;&brvbar; tolerable. This is tolerable for the children, and they are making great progress, progress they made under no other system. Yes, we do copybook and dictation exercises. They are short. It&acirc;&#128;&#153;s like when you tell yourself you can go to the gym for just 15 minutes so that makes it seem tolerable and then you find yourself actually exercising for half an hour or whatever. These books are like that for my sons. I also extremely appreciate that, if you buy the workbooks, this requires very little in the way of daily preparation for me, the busy mom-teacher.</p><p>Oxford Book of American Children&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Poems, although other books of classic children&acirc;&#128;&#153;s poetry would work fine. We memorize poetry. What does this have to do with writing, you ask? And why even do it?</p><p>One of the hard things about learning to write well is learning what &acirc;&#128;&#156;well&acirc;&#128;&#157; means. Filling your head with words and sentence structures you love helps so much toward that end. I was really doubtful of how well my kids would take to this before we started, but they love it. They love being out in the forest for a hike and hearing birds chattering and then all three of us, as a family, start reciting <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=10h5edHD4VkC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;dq=elizabeth+coatsworth+no+shop+does&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=O0jvvyhKgJ&amp;sig=Mxdek9Og1dzSnfxL5sp46FPQhhg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj885PeheDYAhUBUK0KHRfjBCYQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=elizabeth%20coatsworth%20no%20shop%20does&amp;f=false\">No Shop Does the Bird Use</a> by Elizabeth Coatsworth.</p><h2 id=\"reading-skills\">Reading skills</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Teach-Your-Child-Read-Lessons/dp/0671631985/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516217266&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=reading+phonics+preschoolers\">Teach your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons</a> &acirc;&#128;&#147; To be quite honest, I did not believe this book and method would work, but it did, wonderfully. It made teaching the kids to read so painless. I really had no idea how you go about teaching kids to read and was so grateful to find this book.</p><p>Listen to audiobooks with your kids, too, and talk about them with them. It&acirc;&#128;&#153;s a great way to spend driving time. Most recently, my kids loved Tim Curry&acirc;&#128;&#153;s performance of A Christmas Carol and have asked that listening to it every year be incorporated into our Christmas traditions.</p><p>Once they can read, the important thing for a while is to make sure they&acirc;&#128;&#153;re practicing, which will be easiest if you keep books around that are a) level-appropriate (basically, their level plus just a smidgen more challenging &acirc;&#128;&#147; too challenging and they will get frustrated; too easy and they will not improve) and b) they enjoy. My older son loved Magic Tree House books; my younger son dislikes them very strongly but loves loves loves all the Roald Dahl books. Both of these suit the purposes of giving a 7-8 year old child the right balance between just challenging enough and enjoyment. (In general, and I know this is unpopular, but I advise against letting your kids read trash. We all know there are trash books out there &acirc;&#128;&#147; formulaic plots, wooden characters, dialogue that seriously no one would ever say this &acirc;&#128;&#147; and letting your kids read them exclusively is like only feeding them potato chips. Potato chips are fine sometimes; they&acirc;&#128;&#153;re not fine as your only diet.)</p><p>As their reading skills and confidence increase, you need to keep slightly increasing the difficulty. Never force your kid to finish a book they hate. Try to talk calmly with them about why they hate it; try to get them to articulate it. Let them know it&acirc;&#128;&#153;s ok to hate it, even if the reason they hate it is because it&acirc;&#128;&#153;s too hard for them right now. That is totally legit.</p><p>I do not take the unschooling approach of not telling my kids what to read. I want them to experience genres they wouldn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t have otherwise considered reading. My older son didn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t want to read Little House on the Prairie or Charlotte&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Web at first, because he thought they were &acirc;&#128;&#156;girl&acirc;&#128;&#157; books; he ended up loving both of them and went on to read the entire Little House series on his own. It&acirc;&#128;&#153;s legit to start reading a book and find it&acirc;&#128;&#153;s genuinely not for you, although, again, you should try to get your kids to articulate why (not in a confrontational spirit, but because it&acirc;&#128;&#153;s good for their verbal reasoning skills to do this). I hated The Wind in the Willows and also Little Women; my older son has read both and was relieved to find that I&acirc;&#128;&#153;d hated them as much as he did, but we were able to talk about why. However, he likes Dickens and I don&acirc;&#128;&#153;t, and, again, we talk about why.</p><p>A final thing: both of my kids expressed fear as they grew increasingly able to read on their own that I would stop reading to them at night and so we would lose that special time and shared conversation. I suspect a lot of kids actually have this fear and won&acirc;&#128;&#153;t express it or perhaps don&acirc;&#128;&#153;t even realize it (it took a lot of gentle conversation before my kids told me). So, they are 8 and 12 now and we still read together every night. We have read the entire Bunnicula series, the entire Series of Unfortunate Events series, the entire His Dark Materials series. I love it; they love it. Consider relieving your kids&acirc;&#128;&#153; anxiety by showing that you enjoy sharing this with them (your kids may, of course, be different than mine, but don&acirc;&#128;&#153;t assume they don&acirc;&#128;&#153;t have this anxiety just because you didn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t).</p><h1 id=\"field-trips-and-fun\">Field trips and fun</h1><p>From the youngest ages, I have taken my kids to museums and aquariums and national parks just as often as we can. They often have free days for families or whatever (we used to be extremely poor, well below poverty line, so I&acirc;&#128;&#153;m very aware these can be hard to afford), so you can always try to schedule accordingly.</p><ul><li>At National Parks and Monuments, ask for the Junior Ranger packets even if your kids are too young to fill them out by themselves. Use it to talk to them about things you&acirc;&#128;&#153;re seeing, about the history and geography and wildlife of the place.</li><li>Art museums and many history museums also have packets (sometimes things you can take with you, sometimes things you have to return) to guide kids through the exhibits. The <a href=\"http://www.theartmuseum.org/\">Art Museum of Eastern Idaho</a> used to have these great ones that even asked the kids to try to draw copies of some of the art work. They also had a large play area for kids full of exploratory toys, many of which we couldn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t even have afforded or made room for in our house. My kids loved it there. The <a href=\"http://www.boiseartmuseum.org/\">Boise Art Museum</a> has very thorough packets for each exhibit that ask a lot of great open-ended questions that encourage discussion and real engagement with the artwork. We&acirc;&#128;&#153;re finding the Atlanta area museums and attractions also offer a great number of such services, and we&acirc;&#128;&#153;re delighted by it. One reason we moved here is how great a place it is for homeschoolers.</li><li>Get a nature journal of some kind. When your kids are really little, you can write down their observations for them; as they get older, encourage them to keep their own, even if much of it is drawings. Encourage them to notice the seasonal changes, what wildlife the park attracts (even urban parks often have some). Get them a pack of travel colored pencils or whatever drawing tool they like and take it in a backpack with some binoculars each time you have time to take them to a park &acirc;&#128;&#147; even if you only spend 15 minutes or so a week, or even every couple of weeks, doing this. It has led to some of my children&acirc;&#128;&#153;s very happiest memories, and some of my very happiest memories of them.</li><li>If you can, even in a windowbox or a single planter on the patio, take up gardening with your kids. Even better, take up foraging (this is harder to do than gardening, though, but I&acirc;&#128;&#153;ve done it even in somewhat urban areas) which will encourage them (and you) to be very aware of their surroundings and to learn more about the plants they see everyday. Gardening can be high or low commitment, but it&acirc;&#128;&#153;s so good for kids to learn where food comes from because it&acirc;&#128;&#153;s so easy for them to engage with food. And then it can lead to conversations about food chains, ecosystems, worms (big fun) and compost, so many things.</li></ul><p>We also play a lot of games as a family. There are a ton of great ones available for math skills, and the Cranium types of games for various skill building. My kids really loved <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Hi-Cherry-Game-Amazon-Exclusive/dp/B00000IWGQ/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516228239&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=kids+game+cherry\">Hi Ho Cherry-O</a> for early addition skills, and now we play <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Math-for-Love-Prime-Climb/dp/B00PG9590G/ref=sr_1_2?rps=1&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516228290&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=prime+climb\">Prime Climb</a> for a little more advanced arithmetic. When they were little, we played a lot of <a href=\"http://www.lucybingogames.com/\">reptile and bug bingo</a> and (somewhat tediously to the adult) read the information on the backs of each card as we played.</p><p>I don&acirc;&#128;&#153;t know about game recommendations, though. I&acirc;&#128;&#153;m not sure it matters so much what game you&acirc;&#128;&#153;re playing as that you&acirc;&#128;&#153;re playing with your kids. My older son loves chess and cribbage and nearly all other card games. My younger son is much more picky and used to refuse to play games at all, so it took a while to find ones he&acirc;&#128;&#153;d play with us. He really loves this <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Smithsonian-Mission-Museum-Missing-Mummy/dp/B005JAM540/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516228544&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=smithsonian+case+of+the+missing+mummy\">Case of the Missing Mummy</a> game. They have a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Think-Fun-7090-ThinkFun-Knot/dp/B0032UP5R8/ref=sr_1_1?s=toys-and-games&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516228800&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=knot+game\">knotting game</a> they both enjoy, except the younger one is often upset that his older brother can beat him pretty handily at it.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Say you were to optimize everything you possibly could for a particular learning goal. You used the best time-management system, you picked exactly the right tasks that would drive learning improvement, you applied tremendous motivation and effort. How much faster could you learn something than the status quo would expect?</p><p>The answer, of course, will be: it depends. But that&rsquo;s rather unsatisfying, if true, because the crucial question is: what does it depend on?</p><p>Asking how much improvement over the status quo or expected rate of progress is an interesting question in many domains. In some areas, there might be reasons to suggest you could learn something much faster, maybe two or three times as fast. In others, you may not be able to beat expectations much at all, and in others you might actually do worse.</p><p>In this article, I&rsquo;d like to go over what I think some of those conditions are, so you can plan your own expectations.</p><h2>1. Is the Status-Quo at a Competitive Limit?</h2><p>Competitive pressures define many areas of life. The type of competition you face can give a good picture of whether it makes sense to be optimistic or pessimistic about your odds of success, as I&rsquo;ve <a href=\"https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2017/12/05/know-competition/\">written before here</a>.</p><p>Many activities for learning are actually fairly lousy compared to a well-known alternative. Classroom learning of a language, without extensive extracurricular practice compared with learning via continuous immersion, are pretty clear examples. The former is so much worse, that it&rsquo;s not unreasonable to expect massive improvements over the status quo, even if you aren&rsquo;t especially smart or talented.</p><p>This situation can happen because there&rsquo;s no competitive pressure to weed out inferior language learning techniques. Instead, the method tends to fit whatever other constraints are available, which tend to be the limited teacher-to-student ratio in the classroom, classroom hours, the need for gradeable assignments and tests, etc..</p><p>On the other hand, consider a highly standardized test like the MCAT or GRE. In this instance, any test-taker is free to use almost any possible strategy to prepare for the exam. Stakes are high and so inefficient methods are unlikely to survive in the status-quo.</p><p>Here, the potential improvement you can get has to be on the margin of improving over the average human constraints (time-management, motivation, efficiency) rather than picking the low-hanging fruit of a novel and highly-effective studying strategy.</p><p>The level of competition being faced matters here as well. Improving over the average is a lot easier than improving over the elite. So if your goal is to get &ldquo;good&rdquo; at chess, that might be something you could optimize over the typical chess amateur. However, once you hit the grandmaster level, it&rsquo;s unlikely that there will be a lot of optimizations you can make that other skilled players have conspicuously missed.</p><h2>2. How Much Variety is There in Which Goals You Can Pursue?</h2><p>One way you can &ldquo;beat&rdquo; the status-quo is to seek a different goal than is typically sought. If the pursuit has this kind of flexibility, you may be able to find innovations that can allow you to learn more quickly, with different patterns of trade-offs than others have considered.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/\">The MIT Challenge</a> was the best example of this. What enabled me to finish the project was that I was pursuing a highly unusual set of constraints&mdash;only exams and programming projects, with any other material being used on a discretionary basis to achieve those two objectives.</p><p>This project led to some interesting trade-offs: no credentials, no alumni network or extracurricular experiences. My experience was probably also strictly less than an actual MIT student academically, due to other limitations and my own pace. However, done in roughly a quarter of the typical time, there&rsquo;s enough advantages here that it made sense to sacrifice on some other elements.</p><p>In many domains, the world actively discourages this kind of variety. Standardized tests and exams exist to create easy-to-make comparisons, so choosing non-standard approaches reduces the value of such approaches when the goal is to show off a well-defined set of knowledge or skills.</p><p>However, in other domains, the knowledge you acquire has value outside of generating comparisons. In those cases, switching to less conventional goals may enable different methods to beat the status quo.</p><h2>3. How Much Talent and Prior Experience Do You Have?</h2><p>Nothing is learned in isolation. Prior experiences inform new ones. If you accumulate a large amount of prior knowledge it can make learning a seemingly unrelated skill or subject considerably easier for you than someone else. And, although difficult to quantify, innate talents likely play a similar role at mediating advantages some might have over others.</p><p>Unfortunately these factors are rarely under your immediate control. However, the advantages given to a lifetime of experience can be beneficial, as you accumulate more skills and knowledge, that makes further improvements over the status quo more likely in domains that may leverage those skills.</p><h2>4. How Much Effort is Typically Expended?</h2><p>Related to the idea of competition is an understanding of what a &ldquo;typical&rdquo; effort is for a particular goal. By putting in more effort, even if that effort is simply applying a much more rigorous and systematic attack at the problem, you can beat the expected amount.</p><p>When a domain is susceptible to lots of effort and the expected effort is low, this alone can make a big difference.</p><p>This tends to appear more often in amateur domains or for non-elite levels of professional skills. Again, it&rsquo;s hard to put in more effort than truly top competitors because that level of effort usually has been reached by enough to set a new &ldquo;normal&rdquo; for performance in that area.</p><h2>5. How Unusual is Your Project?</h2><p>Conformity bias is high, which means that the space of possible solution paths to a pursuit is typically under-explored. Copying and emulation, particularly of higher-status people, is an instinctive learning process most people use, and which tends to work fairly well most of the time.</p><p>Because the solution space to a given achievement isn&rsquo;t fully explored, however, there&rsquo;s the possibility of getting lucky and hitting upon novel approaches that simply haven&rsquo;t caught on yet. Once again, the level of competition can give some insights into how likely this is, but it&rsquo;s true to some degree in almost all pursuits.</p><p>More unusual approaches to learning something will have a higher variance of outcome than following a tried-and-true path to mastery. However, there are sometimes innovations that can come out of this that are rarely used, yet nonetheless, contribute to performance.</p><h2>What Should You Expect to Achieve?</h2><p>I tend to go into my projects with a much more conservative attitude than it probably seems from the outside. I usually suspect that significant improvements over the status quo probably aren&rsquo;t possible, and then look for reasons why that opinion might be wrong, rather than assume the opposite.</p><p>I think this is especially true for extremely competitive domains, like you&rsquo;d find in important standardized tests, chess, music or athletics. Here learning innovations likely still exist, but they are going to be more modest and harder to find.</p><p>However, many things you might want to learn don&rsquo;t reach this rarefied air of competitive standards and the bar to innovation may be low enough that all it takes is a serious effort to overcome it. I&rsquo;ve already mentioned languages, but tons of other subjects and skills exhibit similarly low bars which can be hurdled over with some thought and motivation.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Back in 2011, in an influential blog post [<a href=\"http://comonad.com/reader/2018/computational-quadrinitarianism-curious-correspondences-go-cubical/#1\">1</a>], Robert Harper coined the term  \"computational trinitarianism\" to describe an idea that had been around a long time &mdash; that the connection between programming languages, logic, and categories, most famously expressed in the Curry-Howard-Lambek correspondence &mdash; should guide the practice of researchers into computation. In particular \"any concept arising in one aspect should have meaning from the perspective of the other two\". This was especially satisfying to those of us trying learning categorical semantics and often finding it disappointing how little it is appreciated in the computer science community writ large.</p><h4>1. Categories</h4><p>Over the years I've thought about trinitarianism a lot, and learned from where it fails to work as much as where it succeeds. One difficulty is that learning to read a logic like a type theory, or vice versa, is almost a definitional trick, because it occurs at the level of reinterpretation of syntax. With categories it is  typically not so easy. (There is a straightforward version of categorical semantics like this &mdash; yielding \"syntactic categories\" &mdash; but it is difficult to connect it to the broader world of categorical semantics, and often it is sidestepped in favor of deeper models.)</p><p>One thing I came to realize is that there is no one notion of categorical semantics &mdash; the way in which the simply typed lambda calculus takes models in cartesian closed categories is fundamentally unlike the way in which linear logics take models in symmetric monoidal categories. If you want to study models of dependent type theories, you have a range of approaches, only some of which have been partially unified by Ahrens, Lumsdaine and Voevodsky in particular [<a href=\"http://comonad.com/reader/2018/computational-quadrinitarianism-curious-correspondences-go-cubical/#2\">2</a>]. And then there are the LCCC models pioneered by Seely for extensional type theory, not to mention the approach that takes semantics directly in toposes, or in triposes (the latter having been invented to unify a variety of structures, and in the process giving rise to still more questions). And then there is the approach that doesn't use categories at all, but multicategories.</p><p>Going the other way, we also run into obstacles: there is a general notion, opposite to the \"syntactic category\" of a type theory, which is the \"internal logic\" of a category. But depending on the form of category, \"internal logic\" can take many forms. If you are in a topos, there is a straightforward internal logic called the Mitchell&ndash;B&eacute;nabou language. In this setting, most \"logical\" operations factor through the truth-lattice of the subobject classifier. This is very convenient, but if you don't have a proper subobject classifier, then you are forced to reach for other interpretations. As such, it is not infrequently the case that we have a procedure for deriving a category from some logical theory, and a procedure for constructing a logical theory from some category, but there is no particular reason to expect that where we arrive, when we take the round-trip, is close to, much less precisely, where we began.</p><h4>2. Spaces, Logics</h4><p>Over the past few years I've been in a topos theory reading group. In the course of this, I've realized at least one problem with all the above (by no means the only one) &mdash; Harper's holy trinity is fundamentally incomplete. There is another structure of interest &mdash; of equal weight to categories, logics, and languages &mdash; which it is necessary to understand to see how everything fits. This structure is <i>spaces</i>. I had thought that it was a unique innovation of homotopy type theory to consider logics (resp. type theories) that took semantics in spaces. But it turns out that I just didn't know the history of constructive logic very well. In fact, in roughly the same period that Curry was exploring the relationship of combinatory algebras to logic, Alfred Tarski and Marshall Stone were developing <i>topological</i> models for intuitionistic logic, in terms of what we call Heyting Algebras [<a href=\"http://comonad.com/reader/2018/computational-quadrinitarianism-curious-correspondences-go-cubical/#3\">3</a>] [<a href=\"http://comonad.com/reader/2018/computational-quadrinitarianism-curious-correspondences-go-cubical/#4\">4</a>]. And just as, as Harper explained, logic, programming and category theory give us insights into implication in the form of entailment, typing judgments, and morphisms, so to, as we will see, do spaces.</p><p>A Heyting algebra is a special type of distributive lattice (partially ordered set, equipped with meet and join operations, such that meet and join distribute over one another) which has an implication operation that satisfies curry/uncurry adjointness &mdash; i.e. such that c &and; a &le; b &lt; -> c &le; a &rarr; b. (Replace meet here by \"and\" (spelled \"*\"), and &le; by &#8866; and we have the familiar type-theoretic statement that c * a &#8866; b &lt; -> c &#8866; a &rarr; b).</p><p>If you haven't encountered this before, it is worth unpacking. Given a set, we equip it with a partial order by specifying a \"&le;\" operation, such that a &le; a, if a &le; b and b &le; a, then a = b, and finally that if a &le; b and b &le; c, then a &le; c. We can think of such things as Hasse diagrams &mdash; a bunch of nodes with some lines between them that only go upwards. If a node b is reachable from a node a by following these upwards lines, then a &le; b. This \"only upwards\" condition is enough to enforce all three conditions. We can define &or; (join) as a binary operation that takes two nodes, and gives a node a &or; b that is greater than either node, and furthermore is the <i>uniquely least</i> node greater than both of them. (Note: A general partial order may have many pairs of nodes that do not have any node greater than both of them, or may that may have more than one incomparable node greater than them.) We can define &and; (meet) dually, as the uniquely greatest node less than both of them. If all elements of a partially ordered set have a join and meet, we have a lattice.</p><p>It is tempting to read meet and join as \"and\" and \"or\" in logic. But these logical connectives satisfy an additional important property &mdash; distributivity: a &amp; (b | c) = (a &amp; b) | (a &amp; c). (By the lattice laws, the dual property with and swapped with or is also implied). Translated for lattices this reads: a &and; (b &or; c) = (a &and; b) &or; (a &and; c). Rather than thinking just about boolean logic, we can think about lattices built from sets &mdash; with meets as union, join as intersection, and &le; given by inclusion. It is easy to verify that such lattices are distributive. Furthermore, every distributive lattice can be given (up to isomorphism) as one built out of sets in this way. While a partially ordered set can have a Hasse diagram of pretty arbitrary shape, a lattice is more restrictive &mdash; I imagine it as sort of the tiled diamonds of an actual lattice like one might use in a garden, but with some nodes and edges possibly removed.</p><p>Furthermore, there's an amazing result that you can tell if a lattice is distributive by looking for just two prototypical non-distributive lattices as sublattices. If neither is contained in the original lattice, then the lattice is distributed. These tell us how distribution can fail in two canonical ways. The first is three incomparable elements, all of which share a common join (the top) and meet (the bottom). The join of anything but their bottom element with them is therefore the top. Hence if we take the meet of two joins, we still get the top. But the meet of any two non-top elements is the bottom and so, if we take the join of any element with the meet of any other two, we get back to the first element, not all the way to the top, and the equality fails. The second taboo lattice is constructed by having two elements in an ordered relationship, and another incomparable to them &mdash; again  augmented with a bottom and top. A similar argument shows that if you go one way across the desired entity, you pick out the topmost of the two ordered elements, and the other way yields the bottommost. (The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributive_lattice#Characteristic_properties\">wikipedia article on distributive lattices</a> has some very good diagrams to visualize all this). So a distributive lattice has even more structure than before &mdash; incomparable elements must have enough meets and joins to prevent these sublattices from appearing, and this forces even more the appearance of a tiled-diamond like structure.</p><p>To get us to a Heyting algebra, we need more structure still &mdash; we need implication, which is like an internal function arrow, or an internal &le; relation. Recall that the equation we want to satisfy is \"c &and; a &le; b &lt; -> c &le; a &rarr; b\". The idea is that we should be able to read &le; itself as an \"external implication\" and so if c and a taken together imply b, \"a implies b\" is the portion of that implication if we \"only have\" c. We can see it as a partial application of the external implication. If we have a lattice that permits infinite joins (or just a finite lattice such that we don't need them), then it is straightforward to see how to construct this. To build a &rarr; b, we just look at <i>every possible</i> choice of c that satisfies c &and; a &le; b, and then take the join of all of them to be our object a &rarr; b. Then, by construction, a &rarr; b is necessarily greater than or equal to any c that satisfies the left hand side of the equation. And conversely, any element that a &rarr; b is greater than is necessarily one that satisfies the left hand side, and the bi-implication is complete. (This, by the way, gives a good intuition for the definition of an exponential in a category of presheaves). Another way to think of a &rarr; b is as the greatest element of the lattice such that a &rarr; b &and; a &le; b (exercise: relate this to the first definition). It is also a good exercise to explore what happens in certain simple cases &mdash; what if a is 0 (false)? What if it is 1? The same as b? Now ask the same questions of b.</p><p>So why is a Heyting algebra a <i>topological</i> construct? Consider any topological space as given by a collection of open sets, satisfying the usual principles (including the empty set and the total set, and closed under union and finite intersection). These covers have a partial ordering, given by containment. They have unions and intersections (all joins and meets), a top and bottom element (the total space, and the null space). Furthermore, they have an implication operation as described above. As an open set, a &rarr; b is given by the meet of all opens c for which a &and; c &le; b. (We can think of this as \"the biggest context, for which a &#8866; b\"). In fact, the axioms for open sets feel almost exactly like the rules we've described for Heyting algebras. It turns out this is only half true &mdash; open sets always give Heyting algebras, and we can turn every Heyting algebra into a space. However, in both directions the round trip may take us to somewhere slightly different than where we started. Nonetheless it turns out that if we take complete Heyting algebras where finite meets distribute over infinite joins, we get something called \"frames.\" And the opposite category of frames yields \"locales\" &mdash; a suitable generalization of topological spaces, first named by John Isbell in 1972 [<a href=\"http://comonad.com/reader/2018/computational-quadrinitarianism-curious-correspondences-go-cubical/#5\">5</a>].  Spaces that correspond precisely to locales are called <i>sober</i>, and locales that correspond precisely to spaces are said to have \"enough points\" or be \"spatial locales\".</p><p>In fact, we don't need to fast-forward to 1972 to get some movement in the opposite direction. In 1944, McKinsey and Tarski embarked on a program of \"The Algebra of Topology\" which sought to describe topological spaces in purely algebraic (axiomatic) terms [<a href=\"http://comonad.com/reader/2018/computational-quadrinitarianism-curious-correspondences-go-cubical/#6\">6</a>]. The resultant closure algebras (these days often discussed as their duals, interior algebras) provided a semantics for S4 modal logic. [<a href=\"http://comonad.com/reader/2018/computational-quadrinitarianism-curious-correspondences-go-cubical/#7\">7</a>] A further development in this regard came with Kripke models for logic [<a href=\"http://comonad.com/reader/2018/computational-quadrinitarianism-curious-correspondences-go-cubical/#8\">8</a>] (though arguably they're really Beth models [<a href=\"http://comonad.com/reader/2018/computational-quadrinitarianism-curious-correspondences-go-cubical/#9\">9</a>]).</p><p>Here's an easy way to think about Kripke models. Start with any partial ordered set. Now, for each object, instead consider instead all morphisms into it. Since each morphism from any object a to any object b exists only if a &le; b, and we consider such paths unique (if there are two \"routes\" showing a &le; b, we consider them the same in this setting) this amounts to replacing each element a with the set of all elements &le; a. (The linked pdf does this upside down, but it doesn't really matter). Even though the initial setting may not have been Heyting algebra, this transformed setting <i>is</i> a Heyting algebra. (In fact, by a special case of the Yoneda lemma!). This yields Kripke models.</p><p>Now consider \"collapsings\" of elements in the initial partial order &mdash; monotone downwards maps taken by sending some elements to other elements less than them in a way that doesn't distort orderings. (I.e. if f(a) &le; f(b) in the collapsed order, then that means that a &le; b in the original order). Just as we can lift elements from the initial partial order into their downsets (sets of elements less than them) in the kripkified Heyting Algebra, we can lift our collapsing functions into collapsing functions in our generated Heyting Algebra. With a little work we can see that collapsings in the partial order also yield collapsings in the Heyting Algebra.</p><p>Furthermore, it turns out, more or less, that you can generate every closure algebra in this way. Now if we consider closure algebras a bit (and this shouldn't surprise us if we know about S4), we see that we can always take a to Ca, that if we send a &rarr; b, then we can send Ca &rarr; Cb, and furthermore that CCa &rarr; Ca in a natural way (in fact, they're equal!). So closure algebras have the structure of an idempotent monad. (Note: the arrows here should not be seen as representing internal implication &mdash; as above they represent the logical turnstile &#8866; or perhaps, if you're really in a Kripke setting, the forcing turnstile &#8873;).</p><p>Now we have a correspondence between logic and computation (Curry-Howard), logic and categories (Lambek-Scott), and logic and spaces (Tarski-Stone). So maybe, instead of Curry-Howard-Lambek, we should speak of Curry-Howard-Lambek-Scott-Tarski-Stone! (Or, if we want to actually bother to say it, just Curry-Howard-Lambek-Stone. Sorry, Tarski and Scott!) Where do the remaining correspondences arise from? A cubical Kan operation, naturally! But let us try to sketch in a few more details.</p><h4>3. Spaces, Categories</h4><p>All this about monads and Yoneda suggests that there's something categorical going on. And indeed, there is. A poset is, in essence, a \"decategorified category\" &mdash; that is to say, a category where any two objects have at most one morphism between them. I think of it as if it were a balloon animal that somebody let all the air out of. We can pick up the end of our poset and blow into it, inflating the structure back up, and allowing multiple morphisms between each object. If we do so, something miraculous occurs &mdash; our arbitrary posets turn into arbitrary categories, and the induced Heyting algebra from their opens turns into the induced category of set-valued presheaves of that category. The resultant structure is a presheaf topos. If we \"inflate up\" an appropriate notion of a closure operator we arrive at a Grothendieck topos! And indeed, the internal language of a topos is higher-order intuitionistic type theory [<a href=\"http://comonad.com/reader/2018/computational-quadrinitarianism-curious-correspondences-go-cubical/#10\">10</a>].</p><h4>4. Spaces, Programming Languages</h4><p>All of this suggests a compelling story: logic describes theories via algebraic syntax. Equipping these theories with various forms of structural operations produces categories of one sort or another, in the form of fibrations. The intuition is that types are spaces, and contexts are <i>also</i> spaces. And furthermore, types are <i>covered</i> by the contexts in which their terms may be derived. This is one sense in which we it seems possible to interpret the Meillies/Zeilberger notion of a type refinement system as a functor [<a href=\"http://comonad.com/reader/2018/computational-quadrinitarianism-curious-correspondences-go-cubical/#11\">11</a>].</p><p>But where do programming languages fit in? Programming languages, difficult as it is to sometimes remember, are more than their type theories. They have a semantic of computation as well. For example, a general topos does not have partial functions, or a fixed point combinator. But computations, often, do. This led to one of the first applications of topology to programming languages &mdash; the introduction of domain theory, in which terms are special kinds of spaces &mdash; directed complete partial orders &mdash; and functions obey a special kind of continuity (preservation of directed suprema) that allows us to take their fixed points. But while the category of dcpos is cartesian closed, the category of dcpos with only appropriately continuous morphisms is <i>not</i>. Trying to resolve this gap, one way or another, seems to have been a theme of research in domain theory throughout the 80s and 90s [<a href=\"http://comonad.com/reader/2018/computational-quadrinitarianism-curious-correspondences-go-cubical/#12\">12</a>].</p><p>Computations can also be concurrent. Topological and topos-theoretic notions again can play an important role. In particular, to consider two execution paths to be \"the same\" one needs a notion of equivalence. This equivalence can be seen, stepwise, as a topological \"two-cell\" tracing out at each step an equivalence between the two execution paths. One approach to this is in Joyal, Nielson and Winskel's treatment of open maps [<a href=\"http://comonad.com/reader/2018/computational-quadrinitarianism-curious-correspondences-go-cubical/#13\">13</a>]. I've also just seen Patrick Schultz and David I. Spivak's \"Temporal Type Theory\" which seems very promising in this regard  [<a href=\"http://comonad.com/reader/2018/computational-quadrinitarianism-curious-correspondences-go-cubical/#14\">14</a>].</p><p>What is the general theme? Computation starts somewhere, and then goes somewhere else. If it stayed in the same place, it would not \"compute\". A computation is necessarily a path in some sense. Computational settings describe ways to take maps between spaces, under a suitable notion of topology. To describe the spaces themselves, we need a language &mdash; that language is a logic, or a type theory. Toposes are a canonical place (though not the only one) where logics and spaces meet (and where, to a degree, we can even distinguish their \"logical\" and \"spatial\" content). That leaves categories as the ambient language in which all this interplay can be described and generalized.</p><h4>5. Spaces, Categories</h4><p>All the above only sketches the state of affairs up to roughly the mid '90s. The connection to spaces starts in the late 30s, going through logic, and then computation. But the categorical notion of spaces we have is in some sense impoverished. A topos-theoretic generalization of a space still only describes, albeit in generalized terms, open covers and their lattice of subobject relations. Spaces have a whole other structure built on top of that. From their topology we can extract algebraic structures that describe their shape &mdash; this is the subject of algebraic topology. In fact, it was in axiomatizing a branch of algebraic topology (homology) that category theory was first compelled to be invented. And the \"standard construction\" of a monad was first constructed in the study of homology groups (as the Godement resolution).</p><p>What happens if we turn the tools of categorical generalization of algebraic topology on categories themselves? This corresponds to another step in the \"categorification\" process described above. Where to go from \"0\" to \"1\" we took a partially ordered set and allowed there to be multiple maps between objects, to go from \"1\" to \"2\" we can now take a category, where such multiple maps exist, and allow there to be multiple maps <i>between maps</i>.  Now two morphisms, say \"f . g\" and \"h\" need not merely be equal or not, but they may be \"almost equal\" with their equality given by a 2-cell. This is just as two homotopies between spaces may themselves be homotopic. And to go from \"2\" to \"3\" we can continue the process again. This yields n-categories ((oo,1)-categories to be precise). And here, another miracle occurs. An (oo,1)-category is, under an appropriate setup (and the question of which setup is appropriate falls under the name \"homotopy hypothesis\" [<a href=\"http://comonad.com/reader/2018/computational-quadrinitarianism-curious-correspondences-go-cubical/#15\">15</a>]) the same thing as a topological space! One setting in which this is especially apparent is that of quasi-categories, which are (oo,1)-categories that are built directly from simplicial sets &mdash; an especially nice categorical model of spaces (the simplicial sets at play here are those that satisfy a \"weak\" Kan condition, which is a way of asking that composition behave correctly).</p><p>It is in these generalized (oo,1)-toposes that homotopy type theory takes its models. And, it is hypothesized that a suitable version of HoTT should in fact be the initial model (or \"internal logic\") of an \"elementary infinity topos\" when we finally figure out how to describe what such a thing is.</p><p>So perhaps it is not that we should be computational trinitarians, or quadrinitarians. Rather, it is that the different aspects which we examine &mdash; logic, languages, categories, spaces &mdash; only appear as distinct manifestations when viewed at a low dimensionality. In the untruncated view of the world, the modern perspective is, perhaps, topological pantheism &mdash; spaces are in all things, and through spaces, all things are made as one.</p><p><i>Thanks to James Deikun and Dan Doel for helpful technical and editorial comments</i></p><p>[1] <a href=\"https://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2011/03/27/the-holy-trinity/\">https://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2011/03/27/the-holy-trinity/<br/>\n[</a>2] <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04310\">https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04310</a><br/>\n[3] <a href=\"http://www.sciacchitano.it/Tempo/Aussagenkalk%C3%BCl%20Topologie.pdf\">http://www.sciacchitano.it/Tempo/Aussagenkalk%C3%BCl%20Topologie.pdf</a><br/>\n[4] <a href=\"https://eudml.org/doc/27235\">https://eudml.org/doc/27235</a><br/>\n[5] <a href=\"http://www.mscand.dk/article/view/11409\">http://www.mscand.dk/article/view/11409</a><br/>\n[6] <a href=\"https://www.dimap.ufrn.br/~jmarcos/papers/AoT-McKinsey_Tarski.pdf\">https://www.dimap.ufrn.br/~jmarcos/papers/AoT-McKinsey_Tarski.pdf</a><br/>\n[7] <a href=\"https://logic.berkeley.edu/colloquium/BezhanishviliSlides.pdf\">https://logic.berkeley.edu/colloquium/BezhanishviliSlides.pdf</a><br/>\n[8] <a href=\"http://comonad.com/reader/2018/computational-quadrinitarianism-curious-correspondences-go-cubical/www2.math.uu.se/~palmgren/tillog/heyting3.pdf\">www2.math.uu.se/~palmgren/tillog/heyting3.pdf</a><br/>\n[9] <a href=\"http://festschriften.illc.uva.nl/j50/contribs/troelstra/troelstra.pdf\">http://festschriften.illc.uva.nl/j50/contribs/troelstra/troelstra.pdf</a><br/>\n[10] <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022404980901024\">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022404980901024</a><br/>\n[11] <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.0263\">https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.0263</a><br/>\n[12] <a href=\"https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~martin/Research/Oldpapers/synthetic91.pdf\">https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~martin/Research/Oldpapers/synthetic91.pdf</a><br/>\n[13] <a href=\"http://www.brics.dk/RS/94/7/index.html\">http://www.brics.dk/RS/94/7/index.html</a><br/>\n[14] <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10258\">https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10258</a><br/>\n[15] <a href=\"https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/homotopy+hypothesis\">https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/homotopy+hypothesis</a></p>"

Every six months or so, a new one pops up, claiming that it has revolutionized UI development. Thousands of developers adopt it into their new projects, blog posts are written, Stack Overflow questions are asked and answered, and then a newer (and even more revolutionary) framework pops up to usurp the throne.</p><p>Using the Stack Overflow Trends tool and some of our internal traffic data, we decided to take a look at some of the more prominent UI frameworks: Angular, React, Vue.js, Backbone, Knockout, and Ember.</p></blockquote><p><a class=\"button\" href=\"https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/01/11/brutal-lifecycle-javascript-frameworks/\">Read More</a></p><h3>The Top JavaScript Trends to Watch in 2018</h3><p>Ryan Chartrand of X-Team for Hackernoon writes:</p><blockquote><p>This time last year, not many had faith that Vue would ever become a big competitor to React when it comes to major companies adopting it, but it was impossible to ignore Vue this year, even sending Angular a bit into the shadows in terms of developer hype.</p></blockquote><p><a class=\"button\" href=\"https://hackernoon.com/the-top-javascript-trends-to-watch-in-2018-a8437dd94425\">Read More</a></p><h3>The State of JavaScript 2017</h3><p>Sacha Greif uses a survey rather than usage data:</p><blockquote><p>We asked over a hundred questions to more than 28,000 developers all over the world, covering topics going from front-end libraries all the way to back-end frameworks.</p></blockquote><p>I particularly enjoyed the <a href=\"https://stateofjs.com/2017/opinions/\">opinions</a>. Lots of people who love working with JavaScript and find it to be moving in the right direction <em>and</em> find it overly complex.</p><p><a class=\"button\" href=\"https://stateofjs.com/2017/\">Read More</a></p><h3>The State of JavaScript Frameworks, 2017</h3><p>This one is from Laurie Voss of npm, which is probably the best source of data for usage but faces interesting challenges with that data:</p><blockquote><p>You can use npm&rsquo;s download statistics to give you insight into the amount of people actively invested in using and maintaining a package. However, probably more important than absolute popularity is growth.</p><p>Packages, once incorporated into software, have very long lives. People very seldom rip packages out of software once they&rsquo;re installed. Because of this very low &ldquo;churn,&rdquo; packages hardly ever decline in usage. Furthermore, nearly all packages in the npm Registry grow in usage as the number of total npm users continues to skyrocket.

Sometimes referred to as a <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">module</em>. It is a collection of methods and variables developers can utilize in their own application.</p><p name=\"eb7a\" id=\"eb7a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Watch the accompanying Real Coding episode <a href=\"https://youtu.be/6DphXwRbPlo\" data-href=\"https://youtu.be/6DphXwRbPlo\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> &#128250;</p><h3 name=\"69c0\" id=\"69c0\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Callback Functions</h3><p name=\"dc54\" id=\"dc54\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Many JavaScript API&rsquo;s and modules provide a final parameter in their methods for something called a callback method. Most of the time you&rsquo;ll see this defined as <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">done</code>, <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">next</code>, <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">callback</code>, or <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">cb</code> (abbreviation for callback). Callback functions are incredibly useful because it enables other developers get more out of your function such as error handling and asynchronous requests. For example, an API method may produce a variety of errors and these errors, if not properly handled, can bring down an entire application. An API utilizing callback methods <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">should </strong>be returning all <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">Error</code> objects as the first parameter in the callback. It is assumed that the first parameter in a callback function is always an error instance.</p><p name=\"ad24\" id=\"ad24\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The function below is a simple example. It&rsquo;s purpose is to double the parameter <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">x</code> and return it via the specified <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">callback</code> function. <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">error</code> starts as <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">null</code>. If any of the conditional checks fail, an <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">Error</code> instance is assigned to <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">error</code>&nbsp;. Then if <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">error</code> exists (it is not null or undefined), then we do not double <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">x</code> and we set the variable <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">double</code> as <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">null</code>; otherwise, <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">x</code> is doubled and assigned to the <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">double</code> variable. After everything is done the function <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">doublePositiveOnly</code> will return the callback method with the first parameter referencing the <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">error</code> variable and the second parameter referencing the <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">double</code> variable.</p><pre name=\"8e75\" id=\"8e75\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\">function doublePositiveOnly(x, callback) {<br/>  let error<br/>  if ( !x )<br/>    error = new Error('x must be defined')<br/>  if ( typeof x !== 'number' )<br/>    error = new Error('x must be a number')<br/>  if ( x &lt; 0 )<br/>    error = new Error('x must be positive')<br/><br/>  const double = error ? null : x * 2</pre><pre name=\"2eb1\" id=\"2eb1\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\">  return callback(error, double)<br/>}</pre><p name=\"56d7\" id=\"56d7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">How would you use this function?</p><pre name=\"79e8\" id=\"79e8\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\">doublePositiveOnly(16, function (err, result) {<br/>  if (err) console.error(err.message)<br/>  console.log(result)<br/>})</pre><h3 name=\"8b50\" id=\"8b50\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--pre\">Promise Functions</h3><p name=\"1f70\" id=\"1f70\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Promise functions in production are easy to recognize as they utilize&nbsp;<code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">.then </code>and&nbsp;<code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">.catch</code> methods to return information back to the user. Nearly all callback functions can be replaced by promises, so lets rebuild our <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">doublePositiveOnly</code> method using promises.</p><pre name=\"7292\" id=\"7292\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\">function doublePositiveOnly( x ) {<br/>  return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {<br/>    let error<br/>    if ( !x )<br/>      error = new Error('x must be defined')<br/>    if ( typeof x !== 'number' )<br/>      error = new Error('x must be a number')<br/>    if ( x &lt; 0 )<br/>      error = new Error('x must be positive')</pre><pre name=\"6663\" id=\"6663\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\">    error ? reject(error) : resolve(x * 2)<br/>  })<br/>}</pre><p name=\"2972\" id=\"2972\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">The above function serves the exact same purpose of the callback implementation. However, this version no longer takes a callback method as a parameter. Instead it either <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">rejects</code> an error or <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">resolves</code> the result. You can use this method like so:</p><pre name=\"01af\" id=\"01af\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\">doublePositiveOnly(16).then(function (result) {<br/>  // do cool stuff with the result<br/>  console.log(result)<br/>}).catch(function (err) {<br/>  // oh no an error! Handle it however you please<br/>  console.error(err.message) <br/>})</pre><p name=\"3b58\" id=\"3b58\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">The readability of a Promise function is much clearer than a callback function as you can easily handle the result as well as any potential errors. There is a lot more to Promises functions I did not cover here, and I encourage you to <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises\" data-href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">learn</a> as much as you can about them.</p><h3 name=\"944f\" id=\"944f\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Callbacks and Promises&nbsp;Together</h3><p name=\"b38a\" id=\"b38a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">We have callbacks and we have promises. They are interchangeable and both satisfy similar needs. Now consider the scenario where we have an API that only supports callback methods. This API is downloaded 1000x times and is now running in production on countless applications. But now the maintainer wants to support Promises as well. Can they do this while also maintaining callback support? <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">YES!</strong></p><p name=\"56e8\" id=\"56e8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Lets look at the callback implementation of <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">doublePositiveOnly</code> once again, but now also with promise support:</p><pre name=\"918f\" id=\"918f\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\">function doublePositiveOnly(x, callback) {<br/>  const func = this.doublePositiveOnly<br/><br/>  if ( callback === undefined ) {<br/>    return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {<br/>      func(x, function (err, result) {<br/>        err ? reject(err) : resolve(result)<br/>      })<br/>    })<br/>  }<br/><br/>  let error<br/>  if ( !x )<br/>    error = new Error('x must be defined')<br/>  if ( typeof x !== 'number' )<br/>    error = new Error('x must be a number')<br/>  if ( x &lt; 0 )<br/>    error = new Error('x must be positive')<br/><br/>  const double = error ? null : x * 2</pre><pre name=\"2aa1\" id=\"2aa1\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\">  return callback(error, double)<br/>}</pre><p name=\"290d\" id=\"290d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">And just like that the <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">doublePositiveOnly</code> method now supports promises as well. It works because first it stores the reference to the function in the <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">func</code> variable. Next, it checks if a callback was passed to the function. If not it returns a promise that passes down the <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">x</code> parameter to another <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">doublePositiveOnly</code> call, and it includes a callback function. This callback function either <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">rejects</code> or <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">resolves</code> the promise just like the promise-only implementation did.</p><p name=\"5ccf\" id=\"5ccf\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">What is great about this solution is you can use just about anywhere and you don&rsquo;t have to edit any parts of the original function!

Enforcing a set of standards and best practices on your code through linter rules and formatters? How about ensuring your code has tests that run automatically during your build process? What about pull requests and code reviews&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;protecting your master branch from direct commits and having peers review your code?</p><p name=\"6d2e\" id=\"6d2e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">They&rsquo;re some of the things that come to mind for me. Automated processes and manual checks. Smart and efficient. Yet, while they&rsquo;re all useful, they really only address half of the problem.</p><h3 name=\"e35a\" id=\"e35a\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">We can&rsquo;t automate everything</h3><p name=\"647f\" id=\"647f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Automation is crucial for maintaining code quality. Static analysis of your syntax with a linter and automated testing should be mandatory. But I can write code that passes all the automated processes without any guarantee to its actual quality.</p><p name=\"6d43\" id=\"6d43\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Does the code follow established patterns? Does it use existing modules, or does it duplicate code? Is everything named sensibly? Is the code in the right place in the codebase? Will this change have wider, unintended, implications? Does this code actually address/solve what it intends to? Does it even <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">work</em>?</p><p name=\"2a75\" id=\"2a75\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Automated processes can&rsquo;t answer those questions for you (yet). If you (or another human being) aren&rsquo;t asking these questions of your code, then you&rsquo;re probably not shipping <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">quality</em> code. That&rsquo;s why we have code reviews.</p><h4 name=\"9ab4\" id=\"9ab4\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">A good code review should be about more than the&nbsp;code</h4><p name=\"5a83\" id=\"5a83\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Of course a code review should be about the code (it&rsquo;s right there in the name after all). But it should also be about the broader questions posed above, and also about the end product.</p><p name=\"03de\" id=\"03de\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I&rsquo;ve noticed a tendency for developers to treat code reviews as perfunctory. A rudimentary check of the modified code. A comment on any obvious mistakes (or just picking a nit or two to look busy).</p><p name=\"6305\" id=\"6305\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Five minutes, job done. <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Looks good to me</em>.</p><p name=\"8755\" id=\"8755\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But, code that doesn&rsquo;t address the requirements of the task is not quality code. Code that produces console errors or visual bugs in the device/browser is not quality code. Neither of those things can be picked up in a perfunctory code review. You can&rsquo;t adequately review code unless you <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">actually run it</em>.</p><p name=\"9cc9\" id=\"9cc9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I propose that a good code review <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">should </em>involve at minimum:</p><ul class=\"postList\"><li name=\"9a64\" id=\"9a64\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">Pulling down the branch to a local environment.</li><li name=\"d32c\" id=\"d32c\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Building the project (and checking that the linter and tests all pass).</li><li name=\"ea39\" id=\"ea39\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Checking that the code runs error free in the target browsers/devices.</li><li name=\"c06e\" id=\"c06e\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Checking that the completed work matches the requirements of the task.</li></ul><p name=\"607b\" id=\"607b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">If there are any issues with any of those steps the pull request should be rejected. Do not pass Go. Do not collect $200. Do not merge to master.</p><p name=\"bf37\" id=\"bf37\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Reviewers should also use the code review as an opportunity to ask questions. If you don&rsquo;t understand the code, then you shouldn&rsquo;t approve the pull request. Don&rsquo;t assume that the author knows more than you do&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;if it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to you, ask for clarification.</p><p name=\"6df3\" id=\"6df3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The reviewer has equal responsibility with the author for the quality of the code. This is a mindset that is essential for maintaining code quality.</p><p name=\"dbcf\" id=\"dbcf\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Comprehensive code reviews go a long way to helping ensure code quality. But there are steps you can take before you even open a pull request. Small things you can do that will help enhance the quality of your code, and reduce the effort required to review it.</p><h3 name=\"6c71\" id=\"6c71\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Double check your own work for completeness</h3><p name=\"686b\" id=\"686b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">I have an annoying habit. When I finish writing the last lines of code for a task, I mentally check the task off as <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">complete</em>.</p><p name=\"f4d3\" id=\"f4d3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If I were to listen to that impatient voice in my head, I&rsquo;d submit my pull request right then. But that code would likely contain many, or all, of the following:</p><ul class=\"postList\"><li name=\"92a3\" id=\"92a3\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">Missed requirements.</li><li name=\"62cb\" id=\"62cb\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Missing test cases.</li><li name=\"b3b5\" id=\"b3b5\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Superfluous, unused or draft code.</li><li name=\"2e95\" id=\"2e95\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Not enough code comments.</li><li name=\"adf6\" id=\"adf6\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Visual bugs in some browsers/devices.</li></ul><p name=\"e238\" id=\"e238\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">If any of those things are true about your code, then your code is not complete. If any of those things end up in the master branch, then you have degraded the quality of the codebase.</p><p name=\"6d14\" id=\"6d14\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The main point here is this: code quality <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">starts</em> with the code author. You shouldn&rsquo;t rely on automated tasks, a code review, quality assurance or user acceptance testing to catch your mistakes.</p><p name=\"8f8f\" id=\"8f8f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Double checking work for completeness is an essential first step toward code quality. It&rsquo;s the easiest step to take, but also the easiest one to ignore.</p><p name=\"d089\" id=\"d089\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">You should only open up a pull request when you are certain your code is complete.</p><h3 name=\"7252\" id=\"7252\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Perform a self review of your&nbsp;branch</h3><p name=\"8b18\" id=\"8b18\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">I&rsquo;m always surprised at how many issues&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;or opportunities to refine a solution&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;I can find in my own code. Issues and opportunities that only become visible to me when I step back and view my changes in isolation.</p><p name=\"1b7d\" id=\"1b7d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">You can review your work and apply your own feedback before assigning a team member to review your work. You can also use this opportunity to leave comments on the pull request to clarify anything for the reviewer.</p><p name=\"4c6b\" id=\"4c6b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Taking time to ensure you work is complete, to correct obvious mistakes, or assess your solution, will enhance the quality of your code. It also reduces the effort required to review it.</p><p name=\"4848\" id=\"4848\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It might also save you some embarrassment. I know it has for me.</p><h3 name=\"72b5\" id=\"72b5\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Ensuring code quality should be an inherent requirement of every development task</h3><p name=\"7a6d\" id=\"7a6d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">You may be thinking that this approach adds time to the length of a task. And you&rsquo;re right, it does. But that isn&rsquo;t a bad thing.</p><p name=\"0dc2\" id=\"0dc2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Efficiency is important, but laziness and apathy is harmful. Apathy leads to a bloated, inconsistent code base. Laziness creates a growing backlog of bad technical debt. We can&rsquo;t be passive and maintain code quality. It requires time and effort.</p><p name=\"8d28\" id=\"8d28\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Changing the culture around code quality can be hard. Project managers and product owners generally aren&rsquo;t concerned about code quality&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;they have their own concerns. Requesting extra time for code quality processes can sometime fall on deaf ears. However, maintaining code quality shouldn&rsquo;t be thought of as something <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">extra&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;</em>it should be an inherent requirement of every task.</p><p name=\"3b9d\" id=\"3b9d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">As developers, if we don&rsquo;t change the way <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">we</em> think about code quality, we can&rsquo;t expect anyone else to.</p><p name=\"8b82\" id=\"8b82\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Nothing I&rsquo;ve talked about here is particularly groundbreaking, nor is it prescriptive. Not every team, workplace, or project is the same, and some of the above may not be applicable to you.</p><p name=\"2d8c\" id=\"2d8c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I do believe there is often a gap between the way developers think about code quality, and the actual actions taken to address it. If you&rsquo;ve found that too, then hopefully there is something you can take away from this article&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;or perhaps you&rsquo;ve already taken a different approach to addressing it. I&rsquo;d love to hear your suggestions in the comments.</p><p name=\"43df\" id=\"43df\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">Thanks for reading!</p></div></div></section></div>"

Securing your server with HTTPS also means that you can&rsquo;t send requests to this server from one that isn&rsquo;t protected by HTTPS. This poses a problem for developers who use a local development environment because all of them run on <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">http://localhost</code> out-of-the-box.</p><p name=\"32a8\" id=\"32a8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">At the startup I&rsquo;m a part of, we decided to secure our AWS Elastic Load Balancer endpoints with HTTPS as part of a move to enhance security.

This root certificate can then be used to sign any number of certificates you might generate for individual domains. If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with the SSL ecosystem, this <a href=\"https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/what-is-ssl-root-certificate/\" data-href=\"https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/what-is-ssl-root-certificate/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">article from DNSimple</a> does a good job of introducing Root SSL certificates.</p><p name=\"a57c\" id=\"a57c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Generate a RSA-2048 key and save it to a file <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">rootCA.key</code>.

What kind of cool stuff can I do today?</p> <p>I did <a href=\"https://ndc-london.com/speaker/scott-hanselman/\">a lightning talk this week at NDC London</a> where I started with a text file that included a CR/LF, <a href=\"https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings/\">Git autocrlf</a>, then talked about typewriters, what a Carriage really is, then the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletype_Model_33\">Teletype Model 33</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bymOIRg5M9E\">Altair 8800</a>, the ASCII chart, then ANSI art, and finally moved on to BBS's and BBS Door Games. I'll do a more extensive post later and I'm going to turn this into a full conference talk, but for the demo I ran a few <strong>BBS Door Games under Windows 10</strong>. Why? Because it's awesome and history is lovely.</p> <p>You can try setting up what I'm going to describe in this post, or you can try telnet'ing to a BBS like the CaveBBS here: <a title=\"telnet://cavebbs.homeip.net\" href=\"telnet://cavebbs.homeip.net\">telnet://cavebbs.homeip.net</a>. You might also want to <a href=\"telnet://towel.blinkenlights.nl\">telnet://towel.blinkenlights.nl</a> for ASCII-based Star Wars! Originally we would call (like literally dial-up one to one) a BBS but ubiquitous internet added telnet as a nice option that persists today.

I'll do a more extensive post later and I'm going to turn this into a full conference talk, but for the demo I ran a few <strong>BBS Door Games under Windows 10</strong>. Why? Because it's awesome and history is lovely.</p><p>You can try setting up what I'm going to describe in this post, or you can try telnet'ing to a BBS like the CaveBBS here: <a title=\"telnet://cavebbs.homeip.net\" href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~telnet://cavebbs.homeip.net\">telnet://cavebbs.homeip.net</a>.

        "description": "<p><em>&hellip;because I&rsquo;m trying to blog more, and this sounds like a fun argument to try to make.</em></p><p>One of the most universally-maligned parts of Haskell is the inclusion of\n<a href=\"https://wiki.haskell.org/Partial_functions\">partial functions</a> in its standard\nlibrary called <code>Prelude</code>. These include <code>head</code> and <code>tail</code> which are undefined\nfor the empty list:</p><pre><code>head :: [a] -> a\nhead (a:_) = a\nhead [] = error \"empty list\"\n</code></pre><p>It&rsquo;s generally understood that the inclusion of these sorts of functions are a\nwart (that the type of <code>head</code> should be <code>[a] -> Maybe a</code>) that has motivated\nthe proliferation of <a href=\"http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/#cat:Prelude\">Prelude alternatives</a>,\nfew of which are used by anyone besides their authors (and fewer still have\nenthusiastic advocates).</p><p>I&rsquo;ve heard a handful of allusions to tricky production bugs that involved some\ndeep dive to find the source of a <code>\"*** Exception: Prelude.head: empty list\"</code>,\nbut personally I can recall only one instance of such a bug in the code I&rsquo;ve\nworked on professionally and it was trivial to track down. I can&rsquo;t recall\nflagging a use of <code>head</code> in a code review either, or raising an eyebrow at some\nuse of the function in some library source I was perusing.</p><p>But most of the time the argument goes that partial functions should be removed\nfor the sake of <em>new users</em>, who will become quickly disillusioned when their\nfirst function blows up with an exception. <em>But you said haskell was safe!</em></p><p>It would be unfortunate if this caused a new user to give up, and maybe this is\na real problem for the community, but here&rsquo;s what I think really happens to\nmost of us:</p><ul><li>Your homework doesn&rsquo;t work; this doesn&rsquo;t matter.</li><li>You use <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=+Prelude.head%3A+empty+list&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8\">Google</a>\nand quickly learn that partial functions (will forever) exist, and that they&rsquo;re bad</li><li>You ask yourself &ldquo;Hm, come to think of it what did I expect to happen&hellip;?&rdquo;</li></ul><p>And so you learn an important lesson, early on and in the most painless way\npossible, you acquire a nose for inferring which functions <em>must</em> be partial,\nan appreciation for compiler warnings that help prevent accidentally-partial\nfunctions, etc.</p><p>Would I recommend designing a standard library around this weird sort of\ntough-love? Probably not, but I think the haskell library ecosystem and\npedagogy have benefited from this wart.</p><p>The problems that get the most (and most passionate) attention are usually not\nthe ones that are the most important, but the ones that are the most easily\nunderstood. I think in the proliferation of Preludes and the discussion around\npartial functions (and the fact that they haven&rsquo;t been excised yet) we see\nevidence of both the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality\">Law of Triviality</a>,\nand a healthy language pedagogy.</p>"

        "summary": "<p>I have been watching the good old Stanford CS course <em>Programming Paradigms</em>. The first half of the course deals with C and serves as great material for learning C. Then the course introduced threads, and concurrent programming in C with some homebrew library. The most complicated example given is this program that simulated the icecream shop. Here are the description of the problem:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This program simulates the daily activity in an ice cream store. The actors in this\nsimulation are the clerks who make ice cream cones, the manager who supervises the\nwork of the clerks, the customers who want to buy the cones, and the cashier who rings\nup each customer. A different thread is launched for each of the players.</p>\n\n<p>Each customer wants to order a few ice cream cones, wait for them to be made, then get\nin line to pay the cashier, and leave after paying. The customer is in a big hurry and\ndoesn&rsquo;t want to wait for one clerk to make several cones, so instead the customer\ndispatches one clerk thread independently for each cone. Once the customer has gotten\ntheir cones made, they get in line for the cashier and wait for their turn. After paying the\ncashier, the customer leaves.</p>\n\n<p>Each clerk thread makes exactly one ice cream cone. The clerk scoops up a cone and\nthen has to have the manager take a look at it to make sure it is just right. If the cone\ndoesn&rsquo;t pass muster, it is thrown away and the clerk has to make another. Once a cone\npasses, the clerk hands the cone to the customer and is done.</p>\n\n<p>The manager sits idle until a clerk needs a cone inspected. When it gets an inspection\nrequest, the inspector determines if it passes and lets the clerk know how the cone fared.\nThe manager is done when all cones have been inspected.</p>\n\n<p>In order to avoid fights breaking out, the line for the cashier must be maintained in FIFO\norder. Thus after getting their cones, a customer &ldquo;takes a number&rdquo; to mark their place in\nthe cashier queue. The cashier then always processes customers from this queue in order\nby number.</p>\n\n<p>The cashier sits idle while there are no customers in line. When a customer is ready to\npay, the cashier handles the bill. Once the bill is paid, the customer can leave. The\ncashier should handle the customers according to position in the queue. Once all\ncustomers have paid, the cashier is finished.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To understand the solution, you can watch this lecture video</p>\n\n\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom:

        "description": "<p>I have been watching the good old Stanford CS course <em>Programming Paradigms</em>. The first half of the course deals with C and serves as great material for learning C. Then the course introduced threads, and concurrent programming in C with some homebrew library. The most complicated example given is this program that simulated the icecream shop. Here are the description of the problem:</p><blockquote><p>This program simulates the daily activity in an ice cream store. The actors in this\nsimulation are the clerks who make ice cream cones, the manager who supervises the\nwork of the clerks, the customers who want to buy the cones, and the cashier who rings\nup each customer. A different thread is launched for each of the players.</p><p>Each customer wants to order a few ice cream cones, wait for them to be made, then get\nin line to pay the cashier, and leave after paying. The customer is in a big hurry and\ndoesn&rsquo;t want to wait for one clerk to make several cones, so instead the customer\ndispatches one clerk thread independently for each cone. Once the customer has gotten\ntheir cones made, they get in line for the cashier and wait for their turn. After paying the\ncashier, the customer leaves.</p><p>Each clerk thread makes exactly one ice cream cone. The clerk scoops up a cone and\nthen has to have the manager take a look at it to make sure it is just right. If the cone\ndoesn&rsquo;t pass muster, it is thrown away and the clerk has to make another. Once a cone\npasses, the clerk hands the cone to the customer and is done.</p><p>The manager sits idle until a clerk needs a cone inspected. When it gets an inspection\nrequest, the inspector determines if it passes and lets the clerk know how the cone fared.\nThe manager is done when all cones have been inspected.</p><p>In order to avoid fights breaking out, the line for the cashier must be maintained in FIFO\norder. Thus after getting their cones, a customer &ldquo;takes a number&rdquo; to mark their place in\nthe cashier queue. The cashier then always processes customers from this queue in order\nby number.</p><p>The cashier sits idle while there are no customers in line. When a customer is ready to\npay, the cashier handles the bill. Once the bill is paid, the customer can leave. The\ncashier should handle the customers according to position in the queue. Once all\ncustomers have paid, the cashier is finished.</p></blockquote><p>To understand the solution, you can watch this lecture video</p><div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;

        "description": "<p>It&rsquo;s been a while since the last jQuery release, but the Core team hasn&rsquo;t been idle. We&rsquo;ve got an all new minor release for you, and it&rsquo;s even got a new feature in it!</p><p>The <code>.addClass()</code>, <code>.removeClass()</code>, and <code>.toggleClass()</code> methods now accept an <strong>array</strong> of classes.</p><pre><code>\r\njQuery(elem).addClass(['dave', 'micha&#322;', 'oleg', 'richard', 'jason', 'timmy']);\r\n\r\n</code></pre><p>Generally, jQuery is not looking to add anything new. We tend to focus more on what we can remove rather than we can we can add. But as soon as we saw this feature request, we wondered how it hadn&rsquo;t been added before.</p><p>There should be no compatibility issues if upgrading from jQuery 3.0+. If you haven&rsquo;t yet upgraded to jQuery 3+, please have a look at the <a href=\"https://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/3.0/\">3.0 Upgrade Guide</a>. The <a href=\"https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate#migrate-older-jquery-code-to-jquery-30\">jQuery Migrate 3.0 plugin</a> will help you to identify compatibility issues in your code.</p><p>Please try out this new release and <a href=\"https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues\">let us know about any issues you experienced</a>.</p><h2>Deprecations</h2><p>We&rsquo;ve pruned some roses, lilies, and sunflowers in this release. Some of these will smell sweeter than others, but put them together, and you&rsquo;ve got a beautiful bouquet of&hellip;depre-carnations?</p><p>These functions have either lost some of their usefulness over time, are considered to be less favorable than available alternatives, or were intended for internal usage from the beginning. While most of these will be removed in jQuery 4.0, it&rsquo;s worth noting that we do not consider the deprecation of a method to mean that it will be removed; it means that we encourage the use of alternatives. For instance, event aliases like <code>.click()</code> will likely never be removed.</p><ul><li>jQuery.now (<a href=\"https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2959\">#2959</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/909e0c99251ee56ec35db0e08d5b1e6219ac8fbc\">909e0c99</a>)</li><li>jQuery.isWindow (<a href=\"https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3629\">#3629</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/c18d608537d8945de6c5855a9475657177fa74ac\">c18d6085</a>)</li><li>jQuery.camelCase(<a href=\"https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3384\">#3384</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/64a289286a743516bce82462200062a647ef3ac0\">64a28928</a>)</li><li>jQuery.proxy (not slated for removal) (<a href=\"https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2958\">#2958</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/3a8e44745c014871bc56e94d91e57c45ae4be208\">3a8e4474</a>)</li><li>jQuery.type (<a href=\"https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3605\">#3605</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/1ea092a54b00aa4d902f4e22ada3854d195d4a18\">1ea092a5</a>)</li><li>jQuery.isNumeric (<a href=\"https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2960\">#2960</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/c4494d4abc84d368d6597889ab45fc07466f8f26\">c4494d4a</a>)</li><li>jQuery.isFunction (<a href=\"https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3609\">#3609</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/3d732cca6b5076a9d13eee98e2b075b37384cd91\">3d732cca</a>)</li><li>Event aliases (<a href=\"https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3214\">#3214</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/022b69a44e42684bdd0029dd456bedb3b495cc24\">022b69a4</a>)</li></ul><h2>Command-line Testing</h2><p>The magnificent <a href=\"https://github.com/Krinkle\">Timo Tijhof</a> has made it possible to <a href=\"https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/ecd8ddea33dc40ae2a57e4340be03faf2ba2f99b\">run all jQuery tests on the command line</a>, using grunt and karma. This is something we&rsquo;ve always wanted but it was complicated by our need for a php server to run ajax tests. Thanks to Timo for making it happen!</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: jQuery no longer runs any tests on PhantomJS 1.x.</p><h2>Download</h2><p>You can get the files from the jQuery CDN, or link to them directly:</p><p><a href=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.0.js\">https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.0.js</a></p><p><a href=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.0.min.js\">https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.0.min.js</a></p><p>You can also get this release from npm:</p><p><code>npm install jquery@3.3.0</code></p><h3>Slim build</h3><p>Sometimes you don&rsquo;t need ajax, or you prefer to use one of the many standalone libraries that focus on ajax requests. And often it is simpler to use a combination of CSS and class manipulation for all your web animations. Along with the regular version of jQuery that includes the ajax and effects modules, we&rsquo;ve released a &ldquo;slim&rdquo; version that excludes these modules. The size of jQuery is very rarely a load performance concern these days, but the slim build is about 6k gzipped bytes smaller than the regular version &ndash; 23.6k vs 30k. These files are also available in the npm package and on the CDN:</p><p><a href=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.0.slim.js\">https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.0.slim.js</a><br/><a href=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.0.slim.min.js\">https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.0.slim.min.js</a></p><p>These updates are already available as the current versions on npm and Bower. Information on all the ways to get jQuery is available at <a href=\"https://jquery.com/download/\">https://jquery.com/download/</a>. Public CDNs receive their copies today, please give them a few days to post the files. If you&rsquo;re anxious to get a quick start, use the files on our CDN until they have a chance to update.</p><h2>Thanks</h2><p>Thank you to all of you who participated in this release by submitting patches, reporting bugs, or testing, including <a href=\"https://github.com/aspala\">Andreas Solledar</a>, Basil Belokon, <a href=\"https://github.com/teabyii\">Boom Lee</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/CDAGaming\">&ldquo;CDAGaming&rdquo;</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/dmethvin\">Dave Methvin</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/eriklax\">Erik Lax</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/hzoo\">Henry Zhu</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/jbedard\">Jason Bedard</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/jobeland\">Jordan Beland</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/matankb\">Matan Kotler-Berkowitz</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/mgol\">Micha&#322;

        "description": "<p> Farhad Manjoo writing for the New York Times has a particularly silly article on <a href=\"https://mobile.nytimes.com/2018/01/17/technology/apple-addiction-iphone.html\">&ldquo;Tech addiction&rdquo; and how it&rsquo;s up to Apple to fix it</a>. The Apple part is the usual Tech Press anti-Apple nonsense. Given that Apple has a relatively small share of the smart phone market, it&rsquo;s hard to see why Apple&mdash;and only Apple&mdash;should be responsible for fixing it. The Macalope does his usual fine job of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3249270/ios/iphone-fixation-it-s-all-on-apple.html\">mocking and demolishing Manjoo&rsquo;s article</a> but I&rsquo;m not interested in the Apple aspect so much as the whole idea of &ldquo;tech addiction.&rdquo; </p><p> The notion of tech addiction is popular among the new Luddites and we keep seeing articles about its horrors and how it&rsquo;s leading to the imminent demise of our children&rsquo;s mental health. As even Manjoo admits, tech addiction isn&rsquo;t a real addiction like drugs or alcohol can be. So what is it? Is it even a real thing? <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/01/17/manjoo-addictive\">John Gruber doesn&rsquo;t think so</a> and neither do I. </p><p> The new Luddites like to point to psychology studies that have examined the putative problem but these studies are from a field that has <a href=\"https://clarivate.com/blog/science-research-connect/open-science-collaboration-authors-rate-reproducibility-psychological-science/\">a reproducibility rate of less than 50%</a>. That&rsquo;s less accurate than flipping a coin. Why should we credit anything they say? It always ends up that they find that kids would rather interact with their friends on their smart phones than listen to adults talk about things they don&rsquo;t care about. Do we really need psychologists to tell us that? </p><p> If you think you have a problem with using your smart phone too much, delete your Facebook and Twitter accounts. They&rsquo;re only exploiting you anyway. If that doesn&rsquo;t work, get rid of your smart phone or seek help. It&rsquo;s not up to Apple or any other company to solve the problem for you. </p>"

Thanks to my computer science teacher at school. And from there I started working on HTML. A few months later, thanks to a friend who was a graphic designer, I also discovered Photoshop. I started combining the design with the code to make web pages with the text editor of that time&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;Notepad.</p><p name=\"2554\" id=\"2554\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I was one of the best students in my school, which meant to everyone what I should be as an adult&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;an Engineer. On my part I love to spend time on the internet, reading, discovering things, and perfecting my knowledge of design and web development. I created an online community. A project to study for the examination of admission into higher education in my country. And I became well known, to the point that some people from Google Spain contacted me to participate in one of their projects<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">.</strong> When they discovered that I was a 14 year old boy, it was not possible, however I had my first contact with Google.</p><p name=\"0641\" id=\"0641\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">After graduating from high school, I enrolled at the university to study electromechanical engineering as recommended by my parents. At that time I felt empty. I felt that in the six semesters I had been studying I was not learning anything that I thought was interesting or wanted to do for the rest of my life.</p><p name=\"0580\" id=\"0580\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In college I was learning things that didn&rsquo;t help in anything I wanted to achieve. The classes were very boring, the people I was studying with didn&rsquo;t seem incredible to me as to consider them colleagues or future members of my team. I was learning a lot of calculus, mechanics and electricity, but only theoretically because most universities don&rsquo;t have the infrastructure to do practical classes on these subjects. And they don&rsquo;t encourage you to think beyond passing the exams.</p><p name=\"506f\" id=\"506f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I also had a job as a teleoperator for Spain and I hated it completely so I decided to leave it also to have total availability of time.</p><p name=\"9e33\" id=\"9e33\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Spending less time at the university and trying to bring my hobbies with me, I started meeting a lot of interesting people in online learning platforms where I started to sneak around without my parents knowledge. This made my performance in college to drop and after thinking about it, I decided to talk to my parents and tell them about what I had in mind.<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"> I wanted to quit college.</strong></p><p name=\"1db6\" id=\"1db6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">After many conversations, some fights and his great disappointment, my father decided to give me the opportunity to leave him for a while and achieve something important with what I liked so I got to it<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">.</strong> As soon as the semester ended, I wrote to one of the platforms of education in which I participated most. Platzi, commented on my case and I was invited to their offices in the capital of my country, 400 kilometers from my city.</p><figure name=\"470b\" id=\"470b\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 525px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 75%;\"></div><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*5UgSHTUMsr1K8sqbqEIqVA.jpeg\" data-width=\"720\" data-height=\"540\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*5UgSHTUMsr1K8sqbqEIqVA.jpeg\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*5UgSHTUMsr1K8sqbqEIqVA.jpeg\"/></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Platzi HQ,&nbsp;2016.</figcaption></figure><p name=\"d334\" id=\"d334\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Without my parents approval, I decided to take the risk of traveling there. I met a lot of people including my best friend Juan David. They helped me get on my new way of life.</p><p name=\"015d\" id=\"015d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The first thing I did was to retake my personal projects. I contacted Google again to participate in the project that I had not been able to participate in because of my age. And since I was 20 years old, I could do it. I was accepted and after two months I received one of the first things that confirmed that I made the right decision. I was invited to Google Spain, all expense paid by Google<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">.</strong> Being Latin American, to think of a trip like this is something really difficult and I was going to be paid everything. It was incredible.</p><p name=\"dc51\" id=\"dc51\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I returned to my country eager to get a new job where I could apply everything I had learned. I was looking for a couple of weeks until I got a job again, this time in a very large company with a diverse team and where I started working as a Digital Graphics designer.</p><p name=\"deb6\" id=\"deb6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Getting your first job is one of the most complex things you are going to encounter. Most companies look for young people but with a lot of experience which is clearly difficult to find.</p><p name=\"a650\" id=\"a650\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In my experience, what best helped me to find my first job and what I would recommend would be<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">:</strong></p><ul class=\"postList\"><li name=\"25e0\" id=\"25e0\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Create a personal brand:</strong><br/>Take care of your professional social networks. Have a good Linkedin profile, follow the people you admire, write about yourself, the things you like, and want to achieve. Add the courses and projects you are doing.</li><li name=\"13ca\" id=\"13ca\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Have a portfolio:</strong><br/>It is very important to apply what you are learning. The best way to do it is to create real projects. Create companies and implement all the digital processes. Create improvements of websites or products you like as you would like to see. And share it in sites such as GitHub, Dribbble, Medium and Twitter, among others. In most jobs, your portfolio is more important than your resume.</li><li name=\"9c00\" id=\"9c00\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Teach what you learn:</strong><br/>&nbsp;The best way to learn is by teaching. Participate in learning platforms (communities) and help your peers, participating in these forums. Join social networking groups and demonstrate what you know.</li></ul><p name=\"6430\" id=\"6430\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">In my first job I began to invest all my free time in studying web programming in platforms like <a href=\"https://platzi.com/\" data-href=\"https://platzi.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Platzi</a> (Spanish), <a href=\"https://teamtreehouse.com/\" data-href=\"https://teamtreehouse.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Treehouse</a> and <a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/\" data-href=\"https://www.udacity.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Udacity</a>. I<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"></strong>started helping the development department because I learned from them and sometimes I helped them solve problems<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">.</strong> I told my boss what was happening and after a test I was able to move to the engineering department as a web developer. It was incredible the first week. I could demonstrate all my talent and thanks to it in 3 months, I was promoted to development leader. A position in which I am right now. I am in the process of a new promotion in another country.</p><figure name=\"ccde\" id=\"ccde\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 700px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 100%;\"></div><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*aejgwON-A9Hioj5_uqKtuQ.jpeg\" data-width=\"747\" data-height=\"747\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*aejgwON-A9Hioj5_uqKtuQ.jpeg\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*aejgwON-A9Hioj5_uqKtuQ.jpeg\"/></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Googleplex, november&nbsp;2017.</figcaption></figure><p name=\"022b\" id=\"022b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">I&rsquo;m also continuing with my project with Google. A couple of weeks ago I was invited again, this time to the offices of Mountain View, California. I met more incredible people and spent some crazy days with some of the top designers and engineers of the Google team.</p><p name=\"b167\" id=\"b167\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">What I can say about my case is that from the moment I decided to leave university to the point where I am now as a development leader it has been a year and a half. I am 22 years and I am working on what I like, in projects with one of the most important companies on the planet. And knowing many countries, people, and amazing cultures.</p><p name=\"e1f5\" id=\"e1f5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">All thanks to having followed my heart and having left the university. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to follow your heart, as Steve Jobs said:</p><blockquote name=\"a09b\" id=\"a09b\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf--hasDropCapModel graf-after--p\">Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven&rsquo;t found it yet, keep looking. Don&rsquo;t give up. As with all matters of the heart, you&rsquo;ll know when you find it.</blockquote><h3 name=\"1ba7\" id=\"1ba7\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--blockquote\">Things I learned from my experience so&nbsp;far:</h3><h4 name=\"c513\" id=\"c513\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h4-strong\">1. Take care of your&nbsp;time</strong></h4><p name=\"56fe\" id=\"56fe\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Most people invest their time in leisure. Watching TV, netflix series, movies, and many other things that are not productive at all. Do the opposite and spend all your time reading, studying, learning. Knowledge is there, on the Internet. It&rsquo;s just a matter of having a little dedication and taking care of all the time you have available<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">.</strong> This is the difference between successful people and those who are not.</p><h4 name=\"48cc\" id=\"48cc\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--h4-em\">2. </em><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h4-strong\">Surround yourself with people who inspire&nbsp;you</strong></h4><p name=\"9a29\" id=\"9a29\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Having people around you who help, support, and motivate you to learn is very important. You&rsquo;re always going to become a bit like the people around you. So you should try to surround yourself with amazing people who help you become incredible.</p><h4 name=\"bbac\" id=\"bbac\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--h4-em\">3. </em><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h4-strong\">Participate in communities</strong></h4><p name=\"dcaa\" id=\"dcaa\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">In every city there are communities of people who come together to talk and learn about a specific topic. This is a great opportunity to meet the kind of people you can learn from. If you don&rsquo;t find a community in your city, you have a chance.<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"> Create your own!</strong></p><h4 name=\"c57c\" id=\"c57c\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--h4-em\">4.</em><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h4-strong\"> Create&nbsp;projects</strong></h4><p name=\"173a\" id=\"173a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Some people believe that just by taking courses and reading about the subject they are interested in they are learning but they are not. The best way to do it is to apply the knowledge you are learning in real projects. This will help you face real problems and you will be much better prepared when you start applying it professionally.</p><h4 name=\"0d71\" id=\"0d71\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--h4-em\">5.</em><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h4-strong\"> Love what you&nbsp;do</strong></h4><p name=\"ebac\" id=\"ebac\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">There is a big difference between people who work hard, those who do it out of obligation and those who do it out of passion.<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"></strong>If you do things out of obligation you won&rsquo;t do them so well or get the same results as when you do them with passion<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">.</strong> Love what you do, enjoy the stress, the hard work and the incredible results it brings.</p><p name=\"e56e\" id=\"e56e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I hope you enjoyed my experience. I hope they have been helpful to those who are going through something like my case. Don&rsquo;t be afraid, if you do what you like, work hard and do it with passion. Nothing can go wrong.<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"></strong>Thank you for reading it and I&rsquo;d appreciate your feedback.</p><p name=\"270c\" id=\"270c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">You can follow me in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/iCarlosSz\" data-href=\"https://twitter.com/iCarlosSz\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> or <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/icarlossz/\" data-href=\"https://www.instagram.com/icarlossz/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>.</p></div></div></section></div>"

She tried saying, &ldquo;No play Ate A*, this mine!&rdquo; This is great! She&rsquo;s learning about owning things. I did point out that the toy she was clutching was actually her cousin&rsquo;s, and we sorted it all out with a minimum of fuss. I look forward to helping her navigate this interesting time.</p><p>She also tried arranging her legs to sit like she saw Tita Ching and Tita Kathy do, and she promptly fell backward onto the bed. I successfully avoided laughing out loud. She figured out shrugging, though, and that got a few chuckles.</p><p>One time, she was looking for Tita Ching. She ran to the living room, but it was empty. She said, &ldquo;Nobody!&rdquo; and then looked for Tita Ching in another room. I wonder if that means I can introduce the concept of zero when counting, too&hellip;</p><p>We&rsquo;ve been focusing on family time: lots of time with her cousins, aunts, and grandmother. Reading works out pretty well as a bonding activity, especially for those of us who aren&rsquo;t up to jumping up and down on the bed.</p><p>Also, she seems to be okay with dolls now, hooray! She used to get quite anxious at the sight of dolls. She still doesn&rsquo;t seek them out, but she doesn&rsquo;t seem to be as bothered by them as she used to be. It&rsquo;s probably due to seeing her cousins have lots of fun playing. Next on my desensitization list: dentists!</p><p>I managed to get the first set of paperwork out the door, hooray! We&rsquo;re also working on sorting out bank accounts. Slow and steady&hellip;</p>"

They like to have freedom to try approaches that they think will be successful. As much as possible, it's probably best to allow your teammates, whoever they are, to have the freedom that they need. At the same time you should expect to have your own freedom. Getting the balance is not easy and sometimes you have to change jobs in order to get into a team where you are allowed the freedom to do your best. In my experience, teams that take this seriously are the best teams to work on (even if they sometimes do stupid things).</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jfbastien/status/951864155128004608\">@jfbastien</a>: It's been 0 days since C++ silently truncated a static constexpr 64-bit integer to 32-bits.

They like to have freedom to try approaches that they think will be successful. As much as possible, it's probably best to allow your teammates, whoever they are, to have the freedom that they need. At the same time you should expect to have your own freedom. Getting the balance is not easy and sometimes you have to change jobs in order to get into a team where you are allowed the freedom to do your best. In my experience, teams that take this seriously are the best teams to work on (even if they sometimes do stupid things).</li><li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jfbastien/status/951864155128004608\">@jfbastien</a>: It's been 0 days since C++ silently truncated a static constexpr 64-bit integer to 32-bits.

The <code>props</code> that we need from our parent component will be <code>total</code> and <code>success</code>. We'll need the <code>total</code> amount of the purchase so we can send it to Stripe, and the <code>success</code> will be something we need to coordinate between this component and the parent, because both components need to know if the payment was successful. I write out the datatypes as well as a default for my props.</p><pre rel=\"JavaScript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\">props: {\n  total: {\n    type: [Number, String],\n    default: '50.00'\n  },\n  success: {\n    type: Boolean,\n    default: false\n  }\n},</code></pre><p>Next, the data we need to store will be the <code>stripeEmail</code> we collected from the form, <code>stripeOptions</code> that I left in to show you can configure some options for your form, as well as <code>status</code> and <code>response</code> that we'll get from communicating with the server and Stripe. We also want to hold whether or not the form was submitted, and whether the form was completed for enabling and disabling the submit button, which can both be booleans.</p><pre rel=\"JavaScript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\">data() {\n  return {\n    submitted: false,\n    complete: false,\n    status: '',\n    response: '',\n    stripeOptions: {\n      // you can configure that cc element.

We have everything we need&mdash;we just need to alter our <code>pay()</code> method, which will do all the heavy lifting for us. I'm going to use <a href=\"https://github.com/axios/axios\">Axios</a> for this, which will receive and transform the data:</p><pre rel=\"Command Line\"><code>npm i axios --save</code></pre><p>...or using Yarn:</p><pre rel=\"Command Line\"><code>yarn add axios</code></pre><p>If you're not familiar with Axios and what it does, check out <a href=\"https://alligator.io/vuejs/rest-api-axios/\">this article</a> for some background information.</p><pre rel=\"JavaScript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\">pay() {\n  createToken().then(data => {\n    this.submitted = true; // we'll change the flag to let ourselves know it was submitted\n    console.log(data.token); // this is a token we would use for the stripeToken below\n    axios\n      .post(\n        'https://sdras-stripe.azurewebsites.net/api/charge?code=zWwbn6LLqMxuyvwbWpTFXdRxFd7a27KCRCEseL7zEqbM9ijAgj1c1w==',\n        {\n          stripeEmail: this.stripeEmail, // send the email\n          stripeToken: data.token.id, // testing token\n          stripeAmt: this.total // send the amount\n        },\n        {\n          headers: {\n            'Content-Type': 'application/json'\n          }\n        }\n      )\n      .then(response => {\n        this.status = 'success';\n        this.$emit('successSubmit');\n        this.$store.commit('clearCartCount');\n        // console logs for you :)\n        this.response = JSON.stringify(response, null, 2);\n        console.log(this.response);\n      })\n      .catch(error => {\n        this.status = 'failure';\n        // console logs for you :)\n        this.response = 'Error: ' + JSON.stringify(error, null, 2);\n        console.log(this.response);\n      });\n  });\n},</code></pre><p>The code above does a number of things:</p><ul><li>It allows us to track whether we've submitted the form or not, with <code>this.submitted</code></li><li>It uses Axios to post to our function.

There are a number of steps you'd want to go through for a production site, including testing, building the app's dist folder, and using real Stripe keys. There are also so many ways to set this up, Serverless functions can be so flexible in tandem with something like Vue. Hopefully this gets you on track and saves you time as you try it out yourself.</p><hr/><hr/><p><small><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://css-tricks.com/creating-vue-js-serverless-checkout-part-four/\">Creating a Vue.js Serverless Checkout Form: Configure the Checkout Component</a> is a post from <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://css-tricks.com\">CSS-Tricks</a></small></p>"

        "description": "<p>I just got back from Beyond Tellerrand in Munich and here&rsquo;s a quick report what you missed if you didn&rsquo;t go.  You might not be interested in my impressions, so let&rsquo;s get my work out of the way first.</p><p>I gave the opening keynote &ldquo;Sacrificing the golden calf of coding&rdquo; in which I explained my transition from a hobby coder to a professional developer and learning along the way that tooling and automation is not the enemy.</p><p>The video is already available on the Vimeo Channel:<br/><br/><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/251427758\">Sacrificing the golden calf of &ldquo;coding&rdquo; &ndash; Christian Heilmann &ndash; btconfMUC2018</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/beyondtellerrand\">beyond tellerrand</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p><p>I also added the slides to Slideshare:</p><p></p><div style=\"margin-bottom:5px\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/cheilmann/sacrificing-the-golden-calf-of-coding-86404119\" title=\"Sacrificing the golden calf of &quot;coding&quot;\" target=\"_blank\">Sacrificing the golden calf of \"coding\"</a></strong> from <strong><a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/cheilmann\" target=\"_blank\">Christian Heilmann</a></strong></div><p></p><p>As you may know, I am a huge fan of Beyond Tellerrand. The organizer is a very old friend of mine and he bends over backwards to make the event something special. He cherry-picks the speakers, treats them immensely well and on a deeply personal level. I feel very proud to be a part of this for many years. On a personal level, I am chuffed about its success as my partner and me met at this event. Thus, she also was a volunteer this time and helped making this event work smoothly for all the attendees.</p><p><img src=\"https://christianheilmann.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IMG_20180115_125025-1024x982.jpg\" alt=\"Anke packing bags\" width=\"100%\"/><img/></p><p>I was worried that branching out from Duesseldorf to Berlin and Munich might be a tough step for the event and as Munich is not a hotspot for events I worried about participation numbers. But I shouldn&rsquo;t have. The even was full up and people stayed for the whole duration. I was heartbroken to hear about a massive personal loss in the organiser&rsquo;s life just before the event and I am even more so impressed how well it worked out.</p><p><img src=\"https://christianheilmann.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IMG_20180117_155950-1024x732.jpg\" alt=\"Attendees painting on the Surface Studio\" width=\"100%\"/></p><p>I <a href=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/XBRbKy2eJdUroFAI3\" title=\"\">shot quite a few photos</a> at the event, none of which of course will match what the official photographers managed to get.</p><p><img src=\"https://christianheilmann.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IMG_20180117_162706-1024x782.jpg\" alt=\"Live Video Editing at BTConf\" width=\"100%\"/></p><p>Beyond Tellerrand is ridiculously fast in releasing the videos of the event as they are mixed live. I love this as with booth duties at the Microsoft stand and personal errands I couldn&rsquo;t see all the talks but will do so now in the nearer future. Here are some picks that may tickle your fancy, too:</p><p>Simon Collison&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Internet of Natural Things&rdquo; talk was a lovely reminder how the internet is not all about cold technical things but also a way to organise your life and record natural things around you. It ends with an intriguing new way how an OS could look to be more helpful for people in their natural environment.</p><p><br/><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/251356531\">The Internet of Natural Things &ndash; Simon Collison &ndash; btconfMUC2018</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/beyondtellerrand\">beyond tellerrand</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p><p>Harry Robert&rsquo;s &ldquo;Why Fast Matters&rdquo; is a talk full of great information on how to measure and improve the speed of your products and what the positive effects of that can be. Harry does not only show tools but also proves why considering improvements can make profound business sense. And he explains how well performing products are truly international and help you reach new markets without breaking the bank of users who live there. His <a href=\"https://speakerdeck.com/csswizardry/why-fast-matters\" title=\"\">slides with all the links are available on speakerdeck</a>.</p><p><br/><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/251519607\">Why Fast Matters &ndash; Harry Roberts &ndash; btconfMUC2018</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/beyondtellerrand\">beyond tellerrand</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p><p>Nadieh Bremer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Data Sketches: A Year of Exotic Data Visualisations&rdquo; is a whirlwind explanation of her last year of creating bafflingly beautiful data visualisations. She doesn&rsquo;t only show off her work and talks about the beauty of it but explains the story warts and all &ndash; from having to scrape and clean up the data to iteratively doing the math on paper to get the effects she wanted to have.</p><p><br/><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/251608376\">Data Sketches: A Year of Exotic Data Visualisations &ndash; Nadieh Bremer &ndash; btconfMUC2018</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/beyondtellerrand\">beyond tellerrand</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p><p>Dina Amin&rsquo;s &ldquo;A tinker story&rdquo; was a total surprise to me and clearly the winner of the event. It already inspired me to write two new talks. Dina is a lady from Egypt who likes to take mechanical things apart and build stop motion animations from them. That&rsquo;s impressive enough, but the real beauty of the talk is about her story. How she dared to do something that crazy and creative instead of pursuing a normal career and how the internet and working with other people over it made that possible. If you want to see some really cool animations and hear a story of empowerment and joy, this is for you.</p><p><br/><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/251600157\">A Tinker Story &ndash;  dina Amin &ndash; btconfMUC2018</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/beyondtellerrand\">beyond tellerrand</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p><p>Make sure to keep checking the channel for more videos coming up. Another absolute highlight was Stefan Sagmeister&rsquo;s closing keynote which was a gorgeous and sweary rant about how we should embrace beauty instead of following outdated Bauhaus ideas. And it ended with the whole audience singing along with him to a song about beauty.</p><p><img src=\"https://christianheilmann.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IMG_20180117_181122-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"Stefan Sagmeister&apos;s Karaoke about beauty\" width=\"100%\"/></p><p>There is no question in my book that Beyond Tellerrand is a worth-while conference to support and attend. My company agreed to support all the events this year and I am looking forward to seeing the next one in May in Duesseldorf. You should, too.</p><p><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BeIGcs2gjI7/\" data-instgrm-version=\"8\" style=\" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);\"><div style=\"padding:8px;\"><div style=\" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;\"><div style=\" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto &lt;del&gt;44px; position:relative; top:&lt;/del&gt;22px; width:44px;&rdquo;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p style=\" margin:8px=\"\">0 0 0; padding:0 4px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BeIGcs2gjI7/\" style=\" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;\" target=\"_blank\">I had a great time at the @btconf <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/2728.png\" alt=\"&#10024;\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\"/><img/> Thank you @marcthiele for this opportunity, for getting amazing speakers all under one roof and for being the good person you are.

        "description": "<h3>JavaScript And The Web</h3><p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/01/11/brutal-lifecycle-javascript-frameworks/\">The Brutal Lifecycle of JavaScript Frameworks | Stack Overflow Blog</a> - This was an interesting analysis on how JavaScript frameworks have risen and fallen.  Among the reasons that it&rsquo;s interesting is that the data appears to be a bit of a Rorschach test.  The post itself is very negative about the pace of change in the JavaScript framework world.  But I saw a lot of twitter takes like this one:</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This &ldquo;new framework every 6-months&rdquo; FUD is comical. The crux is centered on 4 JS frameworks released over the last decade. <br/><br/>4. In 10 years. <br/><br/>It&rsquo;s great for my business, but makes me chuckle. <br/><br/>It&rsquo;s not really moving that fast y&rsquo;all. <a href=\"https://t.co/BiH7UK0M9V\">https://t.co/BiH7UK0M9V</a></p>&mdash; Joel &#9928; (@jhooks) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jhooks/status/951924735654244352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 12, 2018</a></blockquote><p>Personally I lean more toward the side that there&rsquo;s nothing wrong here.  The change in frameworks has come during a large change in use cases and technology used on the web.  Think PWAs verse server-side generated sites, and the large amount of new browser APIs and JavaScript language features.  These things have naturally brought new best practices which have been encoded in frameworks.  While it is true that a jQuery based site from 2009 might be difficult to maintain through today, that has less to do with the lack of support for the technology than it does with the fundamental nature of web development.  It would be much more difficult to build and scale a web application like <a href=\"https://slack.com/\">Slack</a> using only jQuery and other 2009 technologies.<br/>\nWhich is why it was surpassed for <em>web application</em> development first by a wave of frameworks that allowed you to model domain concepts in an object oriented way and tie that to a UI (Backbone, Angular1, Knockout), and then by a second wave that allowed you to do that with more declarative component-based UIs (React, Ember, Angular2+, Vue).  Those evolutions have come to match a real need.</p><p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48270127/can-a-1-a-2-a-3-ever-evaluate-to-true/48274520#48274520\">Can (a ==1 &amp;&amp; a== 2 &amp;&amp; a==3) ever evaluate to true? | Stack Overflow</a> - This was a fun little question.  I don&rsquo;t think I like it as an interview question for JavaScript, since it borders on trivia, and requires in-depth knowledge of the &ldquo;bad parts&rdquo; of JavaScript like <code>==</code> and <code>with</code> or global variable behavior that many new developers are just taught to avoid.  But it&rsquo;s definitely a fun trivia question.

I&rsquo;m not going to try to give anyone investment advise, but it seems clear for now that at minimum these &ldquo;currencies&rdquo; are completely unusable for their theoretical purpose as currency given the price swings.</p>"

This book is the most succinct, honest definition of the role of product management I&rsquo;ve come across. I&rsquo;d recommend it to anyone who:</span></p><ul><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is a new or aspiring PM; </span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is changing companies as a PM;</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is working as a PM and finds there is a lack of clarity around the role;</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Works with PMs and isn&rsquo;t sure what they do;</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leads PMs and isn&rsquo;t sure how to support them.</span></li></ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&rsquo;s a short book, so I&rsquo;ll keep this brief as well. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are three things that I appreciated about this book. It distills insights and knowledge in an accessible way; it validates my experience as a product manager; it challenges me to identify areas for growth. </span></p><h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Distillation </span></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Matt proposes a new skill model for product managers, which he calls CORE (Communication, Organization, Research, and Execution). He says, &ldquo;because product management is a relatively new discipline, and because the role can vary so much from organization to organization, it is tempting to describe product management as a hybrid of other roles.&rdquo; But it&rsquo;s not that, and his CORE concept helps to re-frame the conversation.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Validation</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a working product manager, your work can feel a bit all over the place. Each day&rsquo;s tasks are pretty clear, but when you step back the big picture can be a little fuzzy. A lot of what is written about product management seeks to bring order to this chaos, which is a laudable goal. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Product Management in Practice</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, though, stays true to its title and embraces the uncertainty of PMing IRL. It&rsquo;s clear that Matt gets it, and his advice is based on deep experience. And let&rsquo;s face it, even if you&rsquo;re not looking for PM therapy, it always feels good to have your own experience validated so you know you&rsquo;re not alone!</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This quote particularly resonated with me: &ldquo;For all the books that I had read and all the methodologies that I had studied, the only thing I was left with when I sat back down at my desk was, &ldquo;What the hell am I supposed to <em>do</em> every day?&rdquo; &hellip; In theory, product management is a masterfully played game of chess. In practice, product management often feels like a hundred simultaneous games of checkers.&rdquo; If you&rsquo;re a PM, you&rsquo;re nodding. If you&rsquo;re not a PM, maybe you just stumbled onto our little secret!</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Challenges</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The book is organized around some guiding principles attached to each of the CORE skills. Matt returns to these concepts&ndash;&ldquo;clarity over comfort&rdquo;, for instance&ndash;again and again in different contexts. He also includes stories from product managers working in a variety of companies. He does a great job of gently pointing out the common ways we stray from these core principles, and suggesting how we can get back on track. Each chapter ends with a checklist of things you should make sure you&rsquo;re doing. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I read the book, I started pulling out the areas that I need to work on the most and creating a personal checklist of my own. For me, it was a great way of keeping track of the insights that were most immediately applicable for me, using a framework suggested by the book. Here&rsquo;s my checklist:</span></p><ul><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don&rsquo;t be self-deprecating. It undermines the ability to build alignment on the team.</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create a document like &ldquo;Good Product Manager, Bad Product Manager&rdquo; specific to our organization.</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use </span><a href=\"http://www.amazonianblog.com/2016/11/what-it-means-to-disagree-and-commit-and-how-i-do-it.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ldquo;disagree and commit&rdquo;</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in meetings.</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Work on accommodating different communication styles. They&rsquo;re not bad, they&rsquo;re different.</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Socialize a &ldquo;North Star&rdquo; version of Agile during kickoffs.</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Document process changes and goals as a project progresses (maybe adapt the experiment template from </span><a href=\"https://blog.carbonfive.com/2015/03/19/delivering-value-making-money/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this post</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which outlines a structured approach to experiment planning).</span></li></ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is an accessible, entertaining book. There&rsquo;s already a waiting list for my copy, so you&rsquo;ll have to order your own from </span><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Product-Management-Practice-Real-World-Connective/dp/1491982276\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amazon</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or </span><a href=\"http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920068785.do\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">O&rsquo;Reilly</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

        "description": "<p>Following on my last two posts about accessibility improvements to meyerweb, I&rsquo;ve made two more adjustments: better heading levels and added ARIA labels.</p><p>For the heading levels, the problem I face is one familiar to many authors: what mades sense as an <code>&lt;h1></code> in some situations needs to be an <code>&lt;h2></code> in others.&nbsp; The most common example is the titles of blog posts like this one.&nbsp; On its permalink page, the title of the page is the title of the post.&nbsp; There, it should be an <code>&lt;h1></code>.&nbsp; On archive pages, including the home page of meyerweb, there are a number of posts shown one after the other.&nbsp; In those situations, each post title should be an <code>&lt;h2></code>.</p><p>Part of the redesign&rsquo;s changes were to write a single PHP routine that generated posts and their markup, which I could then simply call from wherever.&nbsp; So I added an optional function parameter that allowed me to indicate the context in which a post was being placed.&nbsp; It goes something like this:</p><pre class=\"php\"><code>&lt; ?php blogpostMarkup(\"archive\"); ?>\r\n</code></pre><pre class=\"php\"><code>function blogpostMarkup($type = \"standalone\") {\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; if ($type == \"archive\") $titletag = \"h2\"; else $titletag = \"h1\";\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; // &hellip;markup is all generated here&hellip;\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; echo $output;\r\n}\r\n</code></pre><p>Or code to that effect.&nbsp; (I did not go copy-paste from my actual code base.)</p><p>So now, heading levels are what they should be, at least on most pages (I may have missed updating some of my old static HTML pages; feel free to point them out in the comments if you find one).&nbsp; As a part of that effort, I removed the <code>&lt;h1></code> from the masthead except on the home page, being the one place it makes sense to be an <code>&lt;h1></code>.</p><p>As for ARIA labels, that came about due to <a href=\"https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2018/01/10/increasing-accessibility/#comment-3479844\">a comment from Phil Kragnes</a> on my last post, where he observed that pages often have multiple elements with a <code>role</code> of <code>navigation</code>.&nbsp; In order to make things more clear to ARIA users, I took Phil&rsquo;s suggestion to add <code>aria-label</code> attributes with clarifying values.&nbsp; So for the page-top skiplinks, I have:</p><pre class=\"html\"><code>&lt;nav role=\"navigation\" aria-label=\"page\" id=\"skiplinks\">\r\n</code></pre><p>Similarly, for the site-navigation bar, I have:</p><pre class=\"html\"><code>&lt;nav role=\"navigation\" aria-label=\"site\" id=\"navigate\">\r\n</code></pre><p>The idea is that screen readers will say &ldquo;Page navigation region&rdquo; and &ldquo;Site navigation region&rdquo;&nbsp;rather than just repeating &ldquo;Navigation region&rdquo; over and over.</p><p>Other than cleaning up individual pages&rsquo; heading levels and the occasional custom layout fix (e.g., the <a href=\"https://meyerweb.com/eric/css/colors/\">Color Equivalents Table</a> needed a local widening of the content column&rsquo;s maximum size), I think the redesign has settled into the &ldquo;occasional tinkering&rdquo; phase.&nbsp; I may do something to spruce up my old Web Review articles (like <a href=\"https://meyerweb.com/eric/articles/webrev/199710.html\">the very first</a>, written when HTML tags were still uppercase!) and I&rsquo;m thinking about adding subnavigation in certain sections, but otherwise I think this is about it.&nbsp; Unless I decide to go <em>really</em> over the top and model my <a href=\"https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/\">Tools page</a> after Simon St. Laurent&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://simonstl.com/\">lovely new Grid design</a>, that is&hellip;</p><p>Of course, if you see something I overlooked, don&rsquo;t hesitate to let me know!&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t guarantee fast response, but I can always guarantee careful consideration.</p>"

Rachel Andrew wrote \"<a href=\"https://rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2016/01/29/vanishing-boxes-with-display-contents/\">Vanishing boxes with display contents</a>\" and clarifies how it all works:</p><blockquote><p>This value becomes useful if you want to add some element because it makes sense in terms of document semantics, but doesn&rsquo;t in terms of display. Perhaps you have some content that makes sense marked up as an article, that article is then a flex item in your layout BUT the elements you really would like to be flex items are nested inside that article. Rather than flattening your markup and remove the article element to enable these inner elements to be part of the flex layout, you could remove the boxes generated by article using display: contents. You then get the best of both worlds, semantic markup plus the visual display your design requires. That sounds good to me.</p></blockquote><p>Manuel Rego <a href=\"https://blogs.igalia.com/mrego/2018/01/11/display-contents-is-coming/\">takes a stab at explaining it</a> as well:</p><blockquote><p><code>display: contents</code> makes that the div doesn&rsquo;t generate any box, so its background, border and padding are not rendered. However the inherited properties like color and font have effect on the child (span element) as expected.</p></blockquote><p>There is also a very related subject to all this: subgrids. Probably literally <code>display: subgrid;</code>. It's probably less important in terms of maintaining semantics than <code>display: contents;</code> but also different. </p><p>Eric Meyer <a href=\"http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2016/01/15/subgrids-considered-essential/\">called</a> subgrids <em>essential</em>: </p><blockquote><p>Grid layout is the first serious candidate to fill that hole in the past two decades, and I don&rsquo;t want to see them hamstrung from the outset.  Subgrids are essential to the adoption of grids.  I hope they&rsquo;ll be implemented as soon as possible</p></blockquote><p>And to understand the difference, Rachel Andrew also wrote \"<a href=\"https://rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2017/07/20/why-display-contents-is-not-css-grid-layout-subgrid/\">Why display: contents is not CSS Grid Layout subgrid</a>\": </p><blockquote><p>You won&rsquo;t get far through a conversation about subgrid in CSS Grid Layout without someone suggesting that <code>display: contents</code> solves most of the problems anyway, so do we really need subgrid? This really isn&rsquo;t the case, <code>display: contents</code> does indeed solve a class of problems, but these are different problems to those that subgrid would help us with.</p></blockquote><hr/><hr/><p><small><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://css-tricks.com/get-ready-for-display-contents/\">Get Ready for `display: contents;`</a> is a post from <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://css-tricks.com\">CSS-Tricks</a></small></p>"

By understanding which components to measure and the most appropriate metrics to focus on for different scenarios, you can begin to plan a monitoring strategy that covers all critical parts of your services.  In our guide about <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/gathering-metrics-from-your-infrastructure-and-applications\">gathering metrics from your infrastructure and applications</a>, we introduced a popular framework to identify high value metrics and then broke a deployment into layers to discuss what to gather at various stages.</p><p>In this guide, we will talk about the components that make up a monitoring system and how to use them to implement your monitoring strategy.  We will begin by reviewing the basic responsibilities of an effective, reliable monitoring system.  Afterwards, we will cover how the elements of a monitoring system fulfill those functional requirements.  Then, we'll talk about how best to translate your monitoring policies into dashboards and alert policies that provide your team with the information they need without requesting their attention at unwarranted times.</p><h2 id=\"review-of-important-qualities-of-a-metrics-monitoring-and-alerting-system\">Review of Important Qualities of a Metrics, Monitoring, and Alerting System</h2><p>In one of the final sections of our <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-metrics-monitoring-and-alerting\">introduction to metrics, monitoring, and alerting</a> guide, we discussed some of <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-metrics-monitoring-and-alerting#important-qualities-of-a-metrics,-monitoring,-and-alerting-system\">the most important qualities of an effective monitoring system</a>.  Since we'll be looking at the core components of these systems momentarily, it's useful to review the characteristics that we identified as being useful or necessary:</p><ul><li><strong>Independent from Most Other Infrastructure</strong>: To accurately collect data and avoid negatively impacting performance, most monitoring components should use dedicated resources separate from other applications.</li><li><strong>Reliable and Trustworthy</strong>: Since monitoring is used to assess the health of other systems, it is important to make sure the monitoring system itself is both correct and available.</li><li><strong>Easy to Use Summary and Detail Views</strong>: Data is not useful if it is not comprehensible or actionable.  Allowing operators to see summary views and then discover more details in areas that are important is incredibly valuable during investigations.</li><li><strong>Effective Strategy for Maintaining Historical Data</strong>: It is important to understand what typical patterns are like in order to recognize anomalies.  Over longer timelines, this might require access to older data that your system must be able to retrieve and access.</li><li><strong>Able to Correlate Factors from Different Sources</strong>: Displaying information from disparate parts of your deployments in an organized way is important for identifying patterns and correlated factors.</li><li><strong>Easy to Start Tracking New Metrics or Infrastructure</strong>: Your monitoring system must evolve as your applications and infrastructure change.  Stale or incomplete monitoring coverage decreases trust in your tooling and data.</li><li><strong>Flexible and Powerful Alerting</strong>: The alerting functionality must be capable of sending notifications in a variety of channels and priorities depending on conditions you define.</li></ul><p>With these attributes in mind, let's take a look at what makes up a monitoring system.</p><h2 id=\"parts-of-a-monitoring-system\">Parts of a Monitoring System</h2><p>Monitoring systems are comprised of a few different components and interfaces that all work together to collect, visualize, and report on the health of your deployment.  We will cover the basic individual parts below.</p><h3 id=\"distributed-monitoring-agents-and-data-exporters\">Distributed Monitoring Agents and Data Exporters</h3><p>While the bulk of the monitoring system might be deployed to a dedicated server or servers, data needs to be gathered from many different sources throughout your infrastructure.  To do this, a monitoring agent&mdash;a small application designed to collect and forward data to a collection endpoint&mdash;is installed on each individual machine throughout the network.  These agents gather statistics and usage metrics from the host where they are installed and send them to the central monitoring software.</p><p>Agents run as always-on daemons on each host throughout the system.  They may include a basic configuration to authenticate securely with the remote data endpoint, define the data frequency or sampling policies, and set unique identifiers for the hosts' data.  To reduce the impact on other services, the agent must use minimal resources and be able to operate with little to no management.  Ideally, it should be trivial to install an agent on a new node and begin sending metrics to the central monitoring system.</p><p>Monitoring agents typically collect generic, host-level metrics, but agents to monitor software like web or database servers are available as well.  For most specialized types of software, however, data will have to be collected and exported by either modifying the software itself, or building your own agent by creating a service that parses the software's status endpoints or log entries.  Many popular monitoring solutions have libraries available to make it easier to add custom instrumentation to your services.  As with agent software, care must be taken to ensure that your custom solutions minimize their footprint to avoid impacting the health or performance of your applications.</p><p>So far, we've made some assumptions about a push-based architecture for monitoring, where the agents push data to a central location.  However, pull-based designs are also available.  In pull-based monitoring systems, individual hosts are responsible for gathering, aggregating, and serving metrics in a known format at an accessible endpoint.  The monitoring server polls the metrics endpoint on each host to gather the metrics data.  The software that collects and presents the data through the endpoint has many of the same requirements as an agent, but often requires less configuration since it does not need to know how to access other machines.</p><h3 id=\"metrics-ingress\">Metrics Ingress</h3><p>One of the busiest part of a monitoring system at any given time is the metrics ingress component.  Because data is constantly being generated, the collection process needs to be robust enough to handle a high volume of activity and coordinate with the storage layer to correctly record the incoming data.</p><p>For push-based systems, the metrics ingress endpoint is a central location on the network where each monitoring agent or stats aggregator sends its collected data.  The endpoint should be able to authenticate and receive data from a large number of hosts simultaneously.  Ingress endpoints for metrics systems are often load balanced or distributed at scale both for reliability and to keep up with high volumes of traffic.</p><p>For pull-based systems, the corresponding component is the polling mechanism that reaches out and parses the metrics endpoints exposed on individual hosts.  This has some of the same requirements, but some responsibilities are reversed.  For instance, if individual hosts implement authentication, the metrics gathering process must be able to provide the correct credentials to log in and access the secure endpoint.</p><h3 id=\"data-management-layer\">Data Management Layer</h3><p>The data management layer is responsible for organizing and recording incoming data from the metrics ingress component and responding to queries and data requests from the administrative layers.  Metrics data is usually recorded in a format called a <strong>time series</strong> which represents changes in value over time.  Time series databases&mdash;databases that specialize in storing and querying this type of data&mdash;are frequently used within monitoring systems.</p><p>The data management layer's primary responsibility is to store incoming data as it is received or collected from hosts.  At a minimum, the storage layer should record the metric being reported, the value observed, the time the value was generated, and the host that produced it.</p><p>For persistence over longer periods of time, the storage layer needs to provide a way to export data when the collection exceeds the local limitations for processing, memory, or storage.  As a result, the storage layer also needs to be able to import data in bulk to re-ingest historic data into the system when necessary.</p><p>The data management layer also needs to provide organized access to the stored information.  For systems using time series databases, this functionality is provided by built-in querying languages or APIs.  These can be used for interactive querying and data exploration, but the primary consumers will likely be the data presentation dashboards and the alert system.</p><h3 id=\"visualization-and-dashboard-layer\">Visualization and Dashboard Layer</h3><p>Built on top of the data management layer are the interfaces that you interact with to understand the data being collected.  Since metrics are time series data, data is best represented as a graph with time on the x-axis.  This way, you can easily understand how values change over time.  Metrics can be visualized over various time scales to understand trends over long periods of time as well as recent changes that might be affecting your systems currently.</p><p>The visualization and data management layers are both involved in ensuring that data from various hosts or from different parts of your application stack can be overlaid and viewed holistically.  Luckily, time series data provides a consistent scale which helps identify events or changes that happened concurrently, even when the impact is spread across different types of infrastructure.  Being able to select which data to overlay interactively allows operators to construct visualizations most useful for the task at hand.</p><p>Commonly used graphs and data are often organized into saved dashboards.  These are useful in a number of contexts, either as a continual representation of current health metrics for always-on displays, or as focused portals for troubleshooting or deep diving into specific areas of your system.  For instance, a dashboard with a detailed breakdown of physical storage capacity throughout a fleet can be important when capacity planning, but might not need to be referenced for daily administration.  Making it easy to construct both generalized and focused dashboards can help make your data more accessible and actionable.</p><h3 id=\"alerting-and-threshold-functionality\">Alerting and Threshold Functionality</h3><p>While graphs and dashboards will be your go-to tools for understanding the data in your system, they are only useful in contexts where a human operator is viewing the page.  One of the most important responsibilities of a monitoring system is to relieve team members from actively watching your systems so that they can pursue more valuable activities.  To make this feasible, the system must be able to ask for your attention when necessary so that you can be confident you will be made aware of important changes.  Monitoring systems use user-defined metric thresholds and alert systems to accomplish this.</p><p>The goal of the alert system is to reliably notify operators when data indicates an important change and to leave them alone otherwise.  Since this requires the system to know what you consider to be a significant event, you must define your alerting criteria.  Alert definitions are composed of a notification method and a metric threshold that the system continuously evaluates based on incoming data.  The threshold usually defines a maximum or minimum average value for a metric over a specified time frame while the notification method describes how to send out the alert.</p><p>One of the most difficult parts of alerting is finding a balance that allows you to be responsive to issues while not over alerting.  To accomplish this, you need to understand which metrics are the best indications of real problems, which problems require immediate attention, and what notification methods are best suited for different scenarios.  To support this, the threshold definition language must be powerful enough to adequately describe your criteria.  Similarly, the notification component must offer methods of communicating appropriate for various levels of severity.</p><h2 id=\"black-box-and-white-box-monitoring\">Black-Box and White-Box Monitoring</h2><p>Now that we've described how various parts of the monitoring system contribute to improving visibility into your deployment, we can talk about some of the ways that you can define thresholds and alerts to best serve your team.  We'll begin by discussing the difference between black-box and white-box monitoring.</p><p>Black-box and white-box monitoring describe different models for monitoring.  They are not mutually exclusive, so often systems use a mixture of each type to take advantage of their unique strengths.</p><p><strong>Black-box monitoring</strong> describes an alert definition or graph based only on externally visible factors.  This style of monitoring takes an outside perspective to maintain a focus on the public behavior of your application or service.  With no special knowledge of the health of the underlying components, black-box monitoring provides you with data about the functionality of your system from a user perspective.  While this view might seem restrictive, this information maps closely to issues that are actively affecting customers, so they are good candidates for alert triggers.</p><p>The alternative, <strong>white-box monitoring</strong>, is also incredibly useful.  White-box monitoring describes any monitoring based on privileged, inside information about your infrastructure.  Because the amount of internal processes vastly exceeds the externally visible behavior, you will likely have a much higher proportion of white-box data.  And since it operates with more comprehensive information about your systems, white-box monitoring has the opportunity to be predictive.  For instance, by tracking changes in resource use, it can notify you when you may need to scale certain services to meet new demand.</p><p>Black-box and white-box are merely ways of categorizing different types of perspectives into your system.  Having access to white-box data, where the internals of your system are visible, is helpful in investigating issues, assessing root causes, and finding correlated factors when an issue is known or for normal administration purposes.  Black-box monitoring, on the other hand, helps detect severe issues quickly by immediately demonstrating user impact.</p><h2 id=\"matching-severity-with-alert-type\">Matching Severity with Alert Type</h2><p>Alerting and notifications are some of the most important parts of your monitoring system to get right.  Without notifications about important changes, your team will either not be aware of events impacting your systems or will need to actively monitor your dashboards to stay informed.  On the other hand, overly aggressive messaging with a high percentage of false positives, non-urgent events, or ambiguous messaging can do more harm than good.</p><p>In this section, we'll talk about different tiers of notifications and how to best use each to maximize their effectiveness.  Afterwards, we'll discuss some criteria for choosing what to alert on and what the notification should accomplish.</p><h3 id=\"pages\">Pages</h3><p>Starting with the highest priority alert type, <strong>pages</strong> are notifications that attempt to urgently call attention to a critical issue with the system.  This category of alert should be used for situations that demand immediate resolution due to their severity.  A reliable, aggressive way of reaching out to people with the responsibility and power to work on resolving the problem is required for the paging system.</p><p>Pages should be reserved for critical issues with your system.  Because of the type of issues they represent, they are the most important alerts your system sends.  Good paging systems are reliable, persistent, and aggressive enough that they cannot be reasonably ignored.  To ensure a response, paging systems often include an option to notify a secondary person or group if the first page is not acknowledged within a certain amount of time.</p><p>Because pages are, by nature, incredibly disruptive, they should be used sparingly: only when it is clear that there is an operationally unacceptable problem.  Often, this means that pages are tied to observed symptoms in your system using black-box techniques.  While it might be difficult to determine the impact of a backend web host maxing out connections, the significance of your domain being unreachable is much less ambiguous and might demand a page.</p><h3 id=\"secondary-notifications\">Secondary Notifications</h3><p>Stepping down in severity are <strong>notifications</strong> like emails and tickets.  These are designed to leave a persistent reminder that operators should investigate a developing situation when they are in a good position to do so.  Unlike pages, notification-style alerts are not meant to indicate that immediate action is required, so they are typically handled by working staff rather than alerting an on-call employee.  If your business does not have administrators working at all times, notifications should be aligned to situations that can wait until the next working day.</p><p>Tickets and emails generated by monitoring help teams understand the work they should be focusing on when they're next active.  Because notifications should not be used for critical issues currently affecting production, they are frequently based on white-box indicators that can predict or identify evolving issues that will need to be resolved soon.</p><p>Other times, notification alerts are set to monitor the same behavior as paging alerts, but set to lower, less critical thresholds.  For instance, you might define a notification alert when your application is showing a small increase in latency over a period of time and have a corresponding page sent when the latency grows to an unreasonable amount.</p><p>In general, notifications are most appropriate in situations that require a response, but don't pose an immediate threat to the stability of your system.  In these cases, you want to bring awareness to an issue so that your team can investigate and mitigate <em>before</em> it impacts users or transforms to a larger problem.</p><h3 id=\"logging-information\">Logging Information</h3><p>While not technically an alert, sometimes you may wish to note specific observed behavior in a place you can easily access later without bringing it to anyone's attention immediately.  In these situations, setting up thresholds that will simply <em>log</em> information can be useful.  These can be written to a file or used to increment a counter on a dashboard within your monitoring system.  The goal is to provide readily compiled information for investigative purposes to cut down on the number of queries operators must construct to gather information.</p><p>This strategy only makes sense for scenarios that are very low priority and need no response on their own.  Their largest utility is correlating related factors and summarizing point-in-time data that can be referenced later as supplemental sources.  You will probably not have many triggers of this type, but they might be useful in cases where you find yourself looking up the same data each time an issue comes up.  Alternatives that provide some of the same benefits are saved queries and custom investigative dashboards.</p><h2 id=\"when-to-avoid-alerting\">When To Avoid Alerting</h2><p>It's important to be clear on what alerts should indicate to your team.  Each alert should signify that a problem is occurring that requires manual human action or input on a decision.  Because of this focus, as you consider metrics to alert on, note any opportunities where reactions could be automated.</p><p>Automated remediation can be designed in cases where:</p><ul><li>A recognizable signature can reliably identify the problem</li><li>The response will always be the same</li><li>The response does not require any human input or decision making</li></ul><p>Some responses are simpler to automate than others, but generally, any scenario that fits the above criteria can be scripted away.  The response can still be tied to alert thresholds, but instead of sending a message to a person, the trigger can kick off the scripted remediation to solve the problem.  Logging each time this occurs can provide valuable information about your system health and the effectiveness of your metric thresholds and automated measures.</p><p>It's important to keep in mind that automated processes can experience problems as well.  It is a good idea to add extra alerting to your scripted responses so that an operator is notified when automation fails.  This way, a hands-off response will handle the majority of cases and your team will be notified of incidents that require intervention.</p><h2 id=\"designing-effective-thresholds-and-alerts\">Designing Effective Thresholds and Alerts</h2><p>Now that we've covered the different alert mediums available and some of the scenarios that are appropriate for each, we can talk about the characteristics of good alerts.</p><h3 id=\"triggered-by-events-with-real-user-impact\">Triggered by Events with Real User Impact</h3><p>As mentioned previously, alerts based on scenarios with real user impact are best.  This means analyzing different failure or performance degrading scenarios and understanding how and when they may bubble up to layers that users interact with.</p><p>This requires a good understanding of your infrastructure redundancy, the relationship of different components, and your organization's goals for availability and performance.  Your aim is to discover the symptomatic metrics that can reliably indicate present or impending user-impacting problems.</p><h3 id=\"thresholds-with-graduated-severity\">Thresholds with Graduated Severity</h3><p>After you've identified symptomatic metrics, the next challenge is identifying the appropriate values to use as thresholds.  You might have to use trial and error to discover the right thresholds for some metrics.</p><p>If available, check historic values to determine what scenarios required remediation in the past.  For each metric, it's good to define an \"emergency\" threshold that will trigger a page and one or several \"canary\" thresholds that are associated with lower priority messaging.  After defining new alerts, ask for feedback on whether the thresholds were overly aggressive or not sensitive enough so that you can fine tune the system to best align to your team's expectations.</p><h3 id=\"contain-appropriate-context\">Contain Appropriate Context</h3><p>Minimizing the time it takes for responders to begin investigating issues helps you recover from incidents faster.  To this end, it is useful to try to provide context within the alert text so operators can understand the situation quickly and start working on appropriate next steps.</p><p>Alerts should clearly indicate the components and systems affected, the metric threshold that was triggered, and the time that the incident began.  The alert should also provide links that can be used to get further information.  These may be links to specific dashboards associated with the triggered metric, links to your ticketing system if automated tickets were generated, or links to your monitoring system's alerts page where more detailed context is available.</p><p>The goal is to give the operator enough information to guide their initial response and help them focus on the incident at hand.  Providing every piece of information you have about the event is neither required nor recommended, but giving basic details with a few options for where to go next can shorten the initial discovery phase of your response.</p><h3 id=\"sent-to-the-right-people\">Sent to the Right People</h3><p>Alerts are not useful if they are not actionable.  Often, whether an alert is actionable depends on the level of knowledge, experience, and permission that the responding individual has.  For organizations of a certain size, deciding on the appropriate person or group to message is straightforward in some cases and ambiguous in others.  Developing an on-call rotation for different teams and designing a concrete escalation plan can remove some of the ambiguity in these decisions.</p><p>The on-call rotations should include enough capable individuals to avoid burnout and alert fatigue.  It is best if your alerting system includes a mechanism for scheduling on-call shifts, but if not, you can develop procedures to manually rotate the alert contacts based on your schedules.  You may have multiple on-call rotations populated by the owners of specific parts of your systems.</p><p>An escalation plan is a second tool to make sure incidents go to the correct people.  If you have staff covering your systems 24 hours a day, it is best to send alerts generated from the monitoring system to on-shift employees rather than the on-call rotation.  The responders can then perform mitigation themselves or decide to manually page on-call operators if they need additional help or expertise.  Having a plan that outlines when and how issues are escalated can minimize unnecessary alerts and preserve the sense of urgency that pages are meant to represent.</p><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>In this guide, we've talked about how monitoring and alerting work in real systems.  We began by looking at how the different parts of a monitoring system work to fulfill organizational needs for awareness and responsiveness.  We discussed the difference between black- and white-box monitoring as a framework for thinking about different alerting cues.  Afterwards, we discussed different types of alerts and how best to match incident severity with an appropriate alert medium.  Lastly, we covered the characteristics of an effective alert process to help you design a system that increases your team's responsiveness.</p>"

        "description": "<p>When I got started with blogging back in 2005, I had been an interface developer for the web since 1999. The big challenges back in 2005 were convincing developers and companies to make sure that things worked in more than one web browser, and that JavaScript wasn't evil and actually pretty competent. And now, in 2018, it's back to the cross-browser support story again (JavaScript seems to be doing fine).</p><p>Granted, 2018 has just started, so let's give it a chance. But in 2017 I saw a lot of web sites/apps released by a multiple of high-profile companies which only worked in one browser: Chrome. And it reminded me a lot of the days in 2005 where the story was the same, but just that back then web sites only worked in Internet Explorer (<code>document.all</code>, anyone?).</p><p>Seeing this same story coming up again, I wanted to try and pinpoint the main reasons for why this happens, and also why it matters building for more than one web browser.</p><h2 id=\"why-people-only-build-for-one-web-browser\">Why people only build for one web browser</h2><p>In 2005, Internet Explorer still had an enormous grip of the web browser market. In September 2002, the Phoenix browser first came out, which would then evolve to Firefox who had its 1.0 release in November 2004. Opera had already been around for a really long time, but it was first a few years into the life of Firefox that we started to see a shift in the web browser market share, and slowly, slowly, IE losing its dominance. When Chrome 1.0 came out in December 2008 it helped strengthen the movement Firefox and the community had started.</p><p>The overall motivations back then for building for only one browser was that IE had a large enough market share for decision makers to feel this would be the most cost efficient way to reach their users. Cross-browser support was occasionally hard and could lead to longer developing times. Netscape 4 and its support was drastically different from IE, and since it became irrelevant, no other browser was big enough to force them to care more deeply about it.</p><p>An extra factor that led to such an extreme dominance over the following years is that a lot of companies built IE-only Intranets with a lot of solutions dependant on proprietary APIs. Pairing that with a slow version upgrade cycle and no other browsers allowed to be installed, this immensely held back the evolution of the web &ndash; in particular when other browsers had a much faster pace with better standards support and implementing new features.</p><p>I believe the situation in 2018 is similar to the initial mindset in 2005: one browser has a big enough piece of the market, and/or with a company's user base, and they believe it's enough to only test in that browser; that supporting more browsers means more work = higher cost and also possibly that they need APIs only supported in that browser.</p><p>Where the situation is different, though, is that now the web standards support across browsers is in a much much better state, and all developers generally have a fast release and improvement pace. Chrome is also &ndash; as opposed to IE a few years in back then &ndash; at the forefront of browser evolution, together with Firefox, and Safari and Edge have gotten a lot better in recent time. Add to that a lot of newer browsers like Samsung Internet, Brave and much more popping up, also holding a very high standard.</p><p>I also think, though, that in this high pace environment, browsers implement new and experimental features, and companies are quick to jump onto them and ship new things based on it, thus leading to certain web apps only working in one browser.</p><h2 id=\"why-you-should-build-for-all-browsers\">Why you should build for all browsers</h2><p>Now that I've talked about what I believe the cause and reasoning might be, I want to tell you why I believe it is crucial that we all build for more than one web browser.</p><p>First, the number of great resources you have available now to find out what is supported where and how to do things are in a better place than it has ever been. <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/\">Can I use</a> has a lot of easily digestible information about browser support &ndash; and I was happy to work directly with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fyrd\">Alexis (@Fyrd)</a> who runs it to get the major Chinese browser in there as well &ndash; and then you have extremely extensive <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/\">documentation and browser compatibility tables at MDN</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.chromestatus.com/\">Chromestatus</a>, <a href=\"https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/status/\">Edge Platform Status</a> and <a href=\"https://platform-status.mozilla.org/\">Firefox Platform Status</a> have a lot of fine-grained details on features and their implementation state. There's also <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/\">Google's Web documentation</a>, the <a href=\"https://webkit.org/blog/\">WebKit blog</a>, <a href=\"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/257854-microsoft-edge-developer\">Edge taking suggestions on UserVoice</a>. And, the Developer Tools in all web browsers is in their best shape ever with tons of tools and help for developers.</p><p>Second, instead of building for one-browser-only, or one-browser-first, if you start in the end of using standardized and implemented features across the board in the 4 major web browser engines there are out there, you're not only reaching more users, you are also much better future-proofing your web site and, counter to what seems to be a common opinion, lowering the amount of technical debt or support needed by using features which are agreed on and shipped.</p><p>Third, this is the key thing that differ the web from anything else. It's the most global and democratic medium we have, the barrier to entry for creating and sharing is quite low and there will be no company approving what you can publish and when. And things built a long time ago mainly still work in web browsers and this longevity is unparalleled. And when you build for just one browser you diminish all of this to a platform by just one company. The web is bigger than that, the web is stronger than that, and I for one believe we all truly need and deserve a platform for everyone.</p><p>So, I understand your reasoning, perspective, goals and challenges. But please, please, consider building something for the web and not just one web browser.</p>"

JavaScript developer tools use source maps to symbolicate backtraces, and to implement source-level stepping in debuggers. Source maps encode debug information similar to that found in <a href=\"http://dwarfstd.org/\">DWARF&rsquo;s <code>.debug_line</code></a> section.</p><p>A source map is a JSON object with a handful of fields. The <code>\"mappings\"</code> field is a string that makes up the bulk of the source map, and contains the bidirectional mappings between source and object locations.</p><p>We will describe the <code>\"mappings\"</code> string&rsquo;s grammar in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form\">extended Backus-Naur form (EBNF)</a>.</p><p>Mappings are grouped by generated JavaScript line number, which is incremented every time a semicolon lays between individual mappings. When consecutive mappings are on the same generated JavaScript line, they are separated by a comma:</p><pre><code class=\"javascript\">&lt;mappings> = [ &lt;generated-line> ] ';' &lt;mappings>\n           | ''\n           ;\n\n&lt;generated-line> = &lt;mapping>\n                 | &lt;mapping> ',' &lt;generated-line>\n                 ;\n</code></pre><p>Each individual mapping has a location in the generated JavaScript, and optionally a location in the original source text, which might also contain an associated name:</p><pre><code class=\"javascript\">&lt;mapping> = &lt;generated-column> [ &lt;source> &lt;original-line> &lt;original-column> [ &lt;name> ] ] ;\n</code></pre><p>Every component of a mapping is a Variable Length Quantity (VLQ) encoded integer. Filenames and associated names are encoded as indices into side tables stored in other fields of the source map&rsquo;s JSON object. Every value is relative to the last occurrence of its type, i.e. a given <code>&lt;source></code> value is the delta since the previous <code>&lt;source></code> value. These deltas tend to be smaller than their absolute values, which means they are more compact when encoded:</p><pre><code class=\"javascript\">&lt;generated-column> = &lt;vlq> ;\n&lt;source> = &lt;vlq> ;\n&lt;original-line> = &lt;vlq> ;\n&lt;original-column> = &lt;vlq> ;\n&lt;name> = &lt;vlq> ;\n</code></pre><p>Each character in a VLQ is drawn from a set of 64 printable ASCII characters comprising the upper- and lower-case letters, the decimal digits, and some symbols. Each character represents a particular 6-bit value. The most significant bit is set on all but the last character in the VLQ; the remaining five bits are prepended to the integer value represented.</p><p>Rather than attempting to translate this definition into EBNF, we provide pseudocode for parsing and decoding a single VLQ below:</p><pre><code class=\"javascript\">constant SHIFT = 5\nconstant CONTINUATION_BIT = 1 &lt;&lt; SHIFT\nconstant MASK = (1 &lt;&lt; SHIFT) - 1\n\ndecode_vlq(input):\n    let accumulation = 0\n    let shift = 0\n\n    let next_digit_part_of_this_number = true;\n    while next_digit_part_of_this_number:\n        let [character, ...rest] = input\n        let digit = decode_base_64(character)\n        accumulation += (digit &amp; MASK) &lt;&lt; shift\n        shift += SHIFT;\n        next_digit_part_of_this_number = (digit &amp; CONTINUATION_BIT) != 0\n        input = rest\n\n    let is_negative = accumulation &amp; 1\n    let value = accumulation >> 1\n    if is_negative:\n        return (-value, input)\n    else:\n        return (value, input)\n</code></pre><h3><span id=\"the-source-map-javascript-library\"></span> The <code>source-map</code> JavaScript Library</h3><p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/source-map\"><code>source-map</code> library</a> is published on <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">npm</a> and maintained by the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/firefoxdevtools\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Firefox Developer Tools team</a> at Mozilla. It is one of the most transitively depended-upon libraries by the JavaScript community, and is downloaded <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/source-map\">10M times per week</a>.</p><p>Like many software projects, the <code>source-map</code> library was written first for correctness, and then later modified to improve performance. By this time, it has seen a good amount of performance work.</p><p>When consuming source maps, the majority of time is spent parsing the <code>\"mappings\"</code> string and constructing a pair of arrays: one sorted by generated JavaScript location, the other sorted by original source location. Queries use binary search on the appropriate array. The parsing and sorting both happen lazily, and don&rsquo;t occur until a particular query requires it. This allows a debugger to list sources, for example, without needing to parse and sort mappings. Once parsed and sorted, querying tends not to be a performance bottleneck.</p><p>The VLQ decoding function takes a string as input, parses and decodes a VLQ from the string, and returns a pair of the value and the rest of the input that was not consumed. This function was originally written in an idiomatic, referentially transparent style to return the pair as an <code>Object</code> literal with two properties:</p><pre><code class=\"javascript\">function decodeVlqBefore(input) {\n  // ...\n  return { result, rest };\n}\n</code></pre><p>Returning a pair that way was found to be costly. JavaScript Just-in-Time (JIT) compilers&rsquo; optimized compilation tiers were unable to eliminate this allocation. Because the VLQ decoding routine is called frequently, this allocation was creating undue pressure on the garbage collector, leading to more frequent garbage collection pauses.</p><p>To remove the allocation, we <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/source-map/pull/135\">modified the procedure</a> to take a second parameter: an <code>Object</code> that gets mutated and serves as an out parameter. Rather than returning a freshly allocated <code>Object</code>, the out parameter&rsquo;s properties are overwritten. This way, we could reuse the same object for every VLQ parse. This is less idiomatic, but much more performant:</p><pre><code class=\"javascript\">function decodeVlqAfter(input, out) {\n  // ...\n  out.result = result;\n  out.rest = rest;\n}\n</code></pre><p>When reaching an unexpected end-of-string or an invalid base 64 character, the VLQ decoding function would <code>throw</code> an <code>Error</code>. We found that JavaScript JITs would emit faster code when we <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/source-map/pull/185\">changed the single base 64 digit decoding function to return <code>-1</code> on failure</a> instead of <code>throw</code>ing an <code>Error</code>. This is less idiomatic, but once again it improved performance.</p><p>When profiling with SpiderMonkey&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~stamourv/papers/optimization-coaching-js.pdf\">JITCoach</a> prototype, we found that SpiderMonkey&rsquo;s JIT was using slow-path polymorphic inline caches for <code>Object</code> property gets and sets on our mapping <code>Object</code>s. The JIT was not emitting the desired fast-path code with direct object slot accesses, because it was not detecting a common <a href=\"http://bibliography.selflanguage.org/_static/implementation.pdf\">&ldquo;shape&rdquo; (or &ldquo;hidden class&rdquo;)</a> shared by all mapping <code>Object</code>s. Some properties would be added in a different order, or omitted completely, for example, when there was no associated name for a mapping. By creating a constructor for mapping <code>Object</code>s that initialized every property we would ever use, we helped the JIT create a common shape for all mapping <code>Object</code>s. This resulted in <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/source-map/pull/188\">another performance improvement</a>:</p><pre><code class=\"javascript\">function Mapping() {\n  this.generatedLine = 0;\n  this.generatedColumn = 0;\n  this.lastGeneratedColumn = null;\n  this.source = null;\n  this.originalLine = null;\n  this.originalColumn = null;\n  this.name = null;\n}\n</code></pre><p>When sorting the two mapping arrays, we use custom comparator functions. When the <code>source-map</code> library was first written, SpiderMonkey&rsquo;s <code>Array.prototype.sort</code> was implemented in C++ for performance<sup id=\"back-foot-1\"><a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/01/oxidizing-source-maps-with-rust-and-webassembly/#foot-1\">1</a></sup>. However, when <code>sort</code> is passed an explicit comparator function and a large array, the sorting code must call the comparator function many times. Calls from C++ to JavaScript are relatively expensive, so passing a custom comparator function made the sorts perform poorly.</p><p>To avoid this, we <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/source-map/pull/186\">implemented our own Quicksort in JavaScript</a>. This not only avoided the C++-to-JavaScript calls, but also let the JavaScript JITs inline the comparator function into the sorting function, enabling further optimizations. This brought us another large performance boost, and again made the code less idiomatic.</p><h3><span id=\"webassembly\"></span> WebAssembly</h3><p><a href=\"http://webassembly.org/\">WebAssembly</a> is a new, low-level, architecture-independent byte code developed for the Web. It is designed for safe and efficient execution and compact binaries, and is developed in the open as a Web standard. It is supported by all major Web browsers.</p><p>WebAssembly exposes a stack machine that maps well onto modern processor architectures. Its instructions operate on a large, linear buffer of memory. It does not support garbage collection, although extending it to work with garbage-collected JavaScript objects is <a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/issues/1079\">planned for the future</a>. Control flow is structured, rather than allowing arbitrary jumps and labels. It is designed to be deterministic and consistent, even where different architectures diverge on edge cases, such as out-of-range shifts, overflows, and canonicalizing <code>NaN</code>s.</p><p>WebAssembly aims to match or beat native execution speed. It is currently <a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/blob/master/papers/pldi2017.pdf\">within 1.5x</a> native execution on most benchmarks.</p><p>Because of the lack of a garbage collector, languages that target WebAssembly are currently limited to languages without a runtime or garbage collector to speak of, unless the collector and runtime are also compiled to WebAssembly. That doesn&rsquo;t happen in practice. Right now, the languages developers are actually compiling to WebAssembly are C, C++, and Rust.</p><h3><span id=\"rust\"></span> Rust</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.rust-lang.org\">Rust</a> is a systems programming language that emphasizes safety and speed. It provides memory safety without relying on a garbage collector. Instead, it statically tracks <em>ownership</em> and <em>borrowing</em> of resources to determine where to emit code to run destructors or free memory.</p><p>Rust is in a great position for compiling to WebAssembly. Since Rust does not require garbage collection, Rust authors don&rsquo;t have to jump through extra hoops to target WebAssembly. Rust has many of the goodies that Web developers have come to expect, and which C and C++ lack:</p><ul><li>Easy building, packaging, publishing, sharing, and documenting of libraries. Rust has <code>rustup</code>, <code>cargo</code>, and the <a href=\"https://crates.io/\">crates.io</a> ecosystem; C and C++ don&rsquo;t have any widely used equivalent.<p></p></li><li><p>Memory safety. <em>Not</em> having to chase down memory corruption in <code>gdb</code>. Rust prevents most of these pitfalls at compile time.</p></li></ul><h2><span id=\"parsing-and-querying-source-maps-in-rust\"></span> Parsing and Querying Source Maps in Rust</h2><p>When we decided to rewrite the hot portions of source map parsing and querying in Rust, we had to decide where the boundary between JavaScript and the WebAssembly emitted by the Rust compiler would be. Crossing the boundary between JavaScript&rsquo;s JITed code to WebAssembly and back currently imposes overhead similar to that of the C++-to-JavaScript calls we mentioned earlier.<sup id=\"back-foot-2\"><a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/01/oxidizing-source-maps-with-rust-and-webassembly/#foot-2\">2</a></sup> So it was important to place this boundary in so as to minimize the number of times we had to cross it.</p><p>A poor choice of where to place the boundary between WebAssembly and JavaScript would have been at the VLQ decoding function. The VLQ decoding function is invoked between one and four times for every mapping encoded in the <code>\"mappings\"</code> string, therefore we would have to cross the JavaScript-to-WebAssembly boundary that many times during parsing.</p><p>Instead, we decided to parse the whole <code>\"mappings\"</code> string in Rust/WebAssembly, and then keep the parsed data there. The WebAssembly heap owns the parsed data in its queryable form. This means that we never have to copy the data out of the WebAssembly heap, which would involve crossing the JavaScript/WebAssembly boundary more often. Instead, we only cross that boundary once each way for every query, plus once each way for every mapping that is a result of that query. Queries tend to produce a single result, or perhaps a handful.</p><p>To have confidence that our Rust implementation was correct, not only did we ensure that our new implementation passed the <code>source-map</code> library&rsquo;s existing test suite, but we also wrote a <a href=\"https://github.com/fitzgen/source-map-mappings/blob/97ba6fb4163f6edfa45f6a3c9e86914ec5ef02a2/tests/quickcheck.rs\">suite of <code>quickcheck</code> property tests</a>.  These tests construct random <code>\"mappings\"</code> input strings, parse them, and then assert that various properties hold.</p><p><a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/source-map-mappings\">Our Rust implementation of <code>\"mappings\"</code> parsing and querying is available on crates.io as the <code>source-map-mappings</code> crate.</a></p><h3><span id=\"base-64-variable-length-quantities\"></span> Base 64 Variable Length Quantities</h3><p>The first step to parsing a source map&rsquo;s mappings is decoding VLQs. We implemented a <a href=\"https://github.com/tromey/vlq\"><code>vlq</code> library</a> in Rust and published it to crates.io.</p><p>The <code>decode64</code> function decodes a single base 64 digit. It uses pattern matching and the idiomatic <code>Result</code>-style error handling.</p><p>A <code>Result&lt;T, E></code> is either <code>Ok(v)</code>, indicating that the operation succeeded and produced the value <code>v</code> of type <code>T</code>, or <code>Err(error)</code>, indicating that the operation failed, with the value <code>error</code> of type <code>E</code> providing the details. The <code>decode64</code> function&rsquo;s return type <code>Result&lt;u8, Error></code> indicates that it returns a <code>u8</code> value on success, or a <code>vlq::Error</code> value on failure:</p><pre><code class=\"rust\">fn decode64(input: u8) -> Result&lt;u8, Error> {\n    match input {\n        b'A'...b'Z' => Ok(input - b'A'),\n        b'a'...b'z' => Ok(input - b'a' + 26),\n        b'0'...b'9' => Ok(input - b'0' + 52),\n        b'+' => Ok(62),\n        b'/' => Ok(63),\n        _ => Err(Error::InvalidBase64(input)),\n    }\n}\n</code></pre><p>With the <code>decode64</code> function in hand, we can decode whole VLQ values. The <code>decode</code> function takes a mutable reference to an iterator of bytes as input, consumes as many bytes as it needs to decode the VLQ, and finally returns a <code>Result</code> of the decoded value:</p><pre><code class=\"rust\">pub fn decode&lt;B>(input: &amp;mut B) -> Result&lt;i64, Error>\nwhere\n    B: Iterator&lt;Item = u8>,\n{\n    let mut accum = 0;\n    let mut shift = 0;\n\n    let mut keep_going = true;\n    while keep_going {\n        let byte = input.next().ok_or(Error::UnexpectedEof)?;\n        let digit = decode64(byte)?;\n        keep_going = (digit &amp; CONTINUATION_BIT) != 0;\n        accum += ((digit &amp; MASK) as u64) &lt;&lt; shift;\n        shift += SHIFT;\n    }\n\n    let negate = (accum &amp; 1) != 0;\n    accum >>= 1;\n    if negate {\n        accum = accum.wrapping_neg();\n    }\n\n    Ok(accum as i64)\n}\n</code></pre><p>Unlike the JavaScript code it is replacing, this code does not sacrifice idiomatic error handling for performance. Idiomatic error handling <em>is</em> performant, and does not involve boxing values on the heap or unwinding the stack.</p><h3><span id=\"the-mappings-string\"></span> The <code>\"mappings\"</code> String</h3><p>We begin by defining some small helper functions. The <code>is_mapping_separator</code> predicate function returns <code>true</code> if the given byte is a separator between mappings, and <code>false</code> if it is not. There is a nearly identical JavaScript function:</p><pre><code class=\"rust\">#[inline]\nfn is_mapping_separator(byte: u8) -> bool {\n    byte == b';' || byte == b','\n}\n</code></pre><p>Next, we define a helper function for reading a single VLQ delta value and adding it to the previous value. The JavaScript does not have an equivalent function, and instead repeats this code each time it wants to read a VLQ delta. JavaScript does not let us control how our parameters are represented in memory, but Rust does. We cannot pass a reference to a number in a zero-cost manner with JavaScript. We could pass a reference to an <code>Object</code> with a number property or we could close over the number&rsquo;s variable in a local closure function, but both of these solutions have associated runtime costs:</p><pre><code class=\"rust\">#[inline]\nfn read_relative_vlq&lt;B>(\n    previous: &amp;mut u32,\n    input: &amp;mut B,\n) -> Result&lt;(), Error>\nwhere\n    B: Iterator&lt;Item = u8>,\n{\n    let decoded = vlq::decode(input)?;\n    let (new, overflowed) = (*previous as i64).overflowing_add(decoded);\n    if overflowed || new > (u32::MAX as i64) {\n        return Err(Error::UnexpectedlyBigNumber);\n    }\n\n    if new &lt; 0 {\n        return Err(Error::UnexpectedNegativeNumber);\n    }\n\n    *previous = new as u32;\n    Ok(())\n}\n</code></pre><p>All in all, the Rust implementation of <code>\"mappings\"</code> parsing is quite similar to the JavaScript implementation it replaces. However, with the Rust, we have control over what is or isn&rsquo;t boxed, whereas in the JavaScript, we do not.  Every single parsed mapping <code>Object</code> is boxed in the JavaScript implementation. Much of the Rust implementation&rsquo;s advantage stems from avoiding these allocations and their associated garbage collections:</p><pre><code class=\"rust\">pub fn parse_mappings(input: &amp;[u8]) -> Result&lt;Mappings, Error> {\n    let mut generated_line = 0;\n    let mut generated_column = 0;\n    let mut original_line = 0;\n    let mut original_column = 0;\n    let mut source = 0;\n    let mut name = 0;\n\n    let mut mappings = Mappings::default();\n    let mut by_generated = vec![];\n\n    let mut input = input.iter().cloned().peekable();\n\n    while let Some(byte) = input.peek().cloned() {\n        match byte {\n            b';' => {\n                generated_line += 1;\n                generated_column = 0;\n                input.next().unwrap();\n            }\n            b',' => {\n                input.next().unwrap();\n            }\n            _ => {\n                let mut mapping = Mapping::default();\n                mapping.generated_line = generated_line;\n\n                read_relative_vlq(&amp;mut generated_column, &amp;mut input)?;\n                mapping.generated_column = generated_column as u32;\n\n                let next_is_sep = input.peek()\n                    .cloned()\n                    .map_or(true, is_mapping_separator);\n                mapping.original = if next_is_sep {\n                    None\n                } else {\n                    read_relative_vlq(&amp;mut source, &amp;mut input)?;\n                    read_relative_vlq(&amp;mut original_line, &amp;mut input)?;\n                    read_relative_vlq(&amp;mut original_column, &amp;mut input)?;\n\n                    let next_is_sep = input.peek()\n                        .cloned()\n                        .map_or(true, is_mapping_separator);\n                    let name = if next_is_sep {\n                        None\n                    } else {\n                        read_relative_vlq(&amp;mut name, &amp;mut input)?;\n                        Some(name)\n                    };\n\n                    Some(OriginalLocation {\n                        source,\n                        original_line,\n                        original_column,\n                        name,\n                    })\n                };\n\n                by_generated.push(mapping);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    quick_sort::&lt;comparators::ByGeneratedLocation, _>(&amp;mut by_generated);\n    mappings.by_generated = by_generated;\n    Ok(mappings)\n}\n</code></pre><p>Finally, we still use a custom Quicksort implementation in the Rust code, and this is the only unidiomatic thing about the Rust code. We found that although the standard library&rsquo;s built-in sorting is much faster when targeting native code, our custom Quicksort is faster when targeting WebAssembly. (This is surprising, but we have not investigated why it is so.)</p><h2><span id=\"interfacing-with-javascript\"></span> Interfacing with JavaScript</h2><p>The WebAssembly foreign function interface (FFI) is constrained to scalar values, so any function exposed from Rust to JavaScript via WebAssembly may only use scalar value types as parameters and return types. Therefore, the JavaScript code must ask the Rust to allocate a buffer with space for the <code>\"mappings\"</code> string and return a pointer to that buffer. Next, the JavaScript must copy the <code>\"mappings\"</code> string into that buffer, which it can do without crossing the FFI boundary because it has write access to the whole WebAssembly linear memory. After the buffer is initialized, the JavaScript calls the <code>parse_mappings</code> function and is returned a pointer to the parsed mappings. Then, the JavaScript can perform any number of queries through the WebAssembly API, passing in the pointer to the parsed mappings when doing so. Finally, when no more queries will be made, the JavaScript tells the WebAssembly to free the parsed mappings.</p><h3><span id=\"exposing-webassembly-apis-from-rust\"></span> Exposing WebAssembly APIs from Rust</h3><p>All the WebAssembly APIs we expose live in a small glue crate that wraps the <code>source-map-mappings</code> crate. This separation is useful because it allows us to test the <code>source-map-mappings</code> crate with our native host target, and only compile the WebAssembly glue when targeting WebAssembly.</p><p>In addition to the constraints of what types can cross the FFI boundary, each exported function requires that</p><ul><li>it has the <code>#[no_mangle]</code> attribute so that it is not name-mangled, and JavaScript can easily call it, and</li><li>it is marked <code>extern \"C\"</code> so that it is publicly exported in the final <code>.wasm</code> file.</li></ul><p>Unlike the core library, this glue code that exposes functionality to JavaScript via WebAssembly does, by necessity, frequently use <code>unsafe</code>. Calling <code>extern</code> functions and using pointers received from across an FFI boundary is always <code>unsafe</code>, because the Rust compiler cannot verify the safety of the other side. Ultimately this is less concerning with WebAssembly than it might be with other targets &mdash; the worst we can do is <code>trap</code> (which causes an <code>Error</code> to be raised on the JavaScript side) or return an incorrect answer. Much tamer than the worst case scenarios with native binaries where executable memory is in the same address space as writable memory, and an attacker can trick the program into jumping to memory where they&rsquo;ve inserted some shell code.</p><p>The simplest function we export is the function to get the last error that occurred in the library. This provides similar functionality as <code>errno</code> from <code>libc</code>, and is called by JavaScript when some API call fails and the JavaScript would like to know what kind of failure it was. We always maintain the most recent error in a global, and this function retrieves that error value:</p><pre><code class=\"rust\">static mut LAST_ERROR: Option&lt;Error> = None;\n\n#[no_mangle]\npub extern \"C\" fn get_last_error() -> u32 {\n    unsafe {\n        match LAST_ERROR {\n            None => 0,\n            Some(e) => e as u32,\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre><p>The first interaction between JavaScript and Rust is allocating a buffer with space to hold the <code>\"mappings\"</code> string. We desire an owned, contiguous chunk of <code>u8</code>s, which suggests using <code>Vec&lt;u8></code>, but we want to expose a single pointer to JavaScript. A single pointer can cross the FFI boundary, and is easier to wrangle on the JavaScript side. We can either add a layer of indirection with <code>Box&lt;Vec&lt;u8>></code> or we can save the extra data needed to reconstruct the vector on the side. We choose the latter approach.</p><p>A vector is a triple of</p><ol><li>a pointer to the heap-allocated elements,</li><li>the capacity of that allocation, and</li><li>the length of the initialized elements.</li></ol><p>Since we are only exposing the pointer to the heap-allocated elements to JavaScript, we need a way to save the length and capacity so we can reconstruct the <code>Vec</code> on demand. We allocate two extra words of space and store the length and capacity in the first two words of the heap elements. Then we give JavaScript a pointer to the space just after those extra words:</p><pre><code class=\"rust\">#[no_mangle]\npub extern \"C\" fn allocate_mappings(size: usize) -> *mut u8 {\n    // Make sure that we don't lose any bytes from size in the remainder.\n    let size_in_units_of_usize = (size + mem::size_of::&lt;usize>() - 1)\n        / mem::size_of::&lt;usize>();\n\n    // Make room for two additional `usize`s: we'll stuff capacity and\n    // length in there.\n    let mut vec: Vec&lt;usize> = Vec::with_capacity(size_in_units_of_usize + 2);\n\n    // And do the stuffing.\n    let capacity = vec.capacity();\n    vec.push(capacity);\n    vec.push(size);\n\n    // Leak the vec's elements and get a pointer to them.\n    let ptr = vec.as_mut_ptr();\n    debug_assert!(!ptr.is_null());\n    mem::forget(vec);\n\n    // Advance the pointer past our stuffed data and return it to JS,\n    // so that JS can write the mappings string into it.\n    let ptr = ptr.wrapping_offset(2) as *mut u8;\n    assert_pointer_is_word_aligned(ptr);\n    ptr\n}\n</code></pre><p>After initializing the buffer for the <code>\"mappings\"</code> string, JavaScript passes ownership of the buffer to <code>parse_mappings</code>, which parses the string into a queryable structure. A pointer to the queryable <code>Mappings</code> structure is returned, or <code>NULL</code> if there was some kind of parse failure.</p><p>The first thing that <code>parse_mappings</code> must do is recover the <code>Vec</code>&lsquo;s length and capacity. Next, it constructs a slice of the <code>\"mappings\"</code> string data, constrains the lifetime of the slice to the current scope to double check that we don&rsquo;t access the slice again after its deallocated, and call into our library&rsquo;s <code>\"mappings\"</code> string parsing function. Regardless whether parsing succeeded or not, we deallocate the buffer holding the <code>\"mappings\"</code> string, and return a pointer to the parsed structure or save any error that may have occurred and return <code>NULL</code>.</p><pre><code class=\"rust\">/// Force the `reference`'s lifetime to match the `scope`'s\n/// lifetime.

The results of a query are either a single <code>Mapping</code> or set of many <code>Mapping</code>s, and a <code>Mapping</code> can&rsquo;t cross the FFI boundary as-is unless we box it.  We do not wish to box <code>Mapping</code>s since we would <em>also</em> need to provide getters for each of its fields, causing code bloat on top of the costs of allocation and indirection. Our solution is to call an imported function for each <code>Mapping</code> query result.</p><p>The <code>mappings_callback</code> is an <code>extern</code> function without definition, which translates to an imported function in WebAssembly that the JavaScript must provide when instantiating the WebAssembly module. The <code>mappings_callback</code> takes a <code>Mapping</code> that is exploded into its member parts: each field in a transitively flattened <code>Mapping</code> is translated into a parameter so that it can cross the FFI boundary. For <code>Option&lt;T></code> members, we add a <code>bool</code> parameter that serves as a discriminant, determining whether the <code>Option&lt;T></code> is <code>Some</code> or <code>None</code>, and therefore whether the following <code>T</code> parameter is valid or garbage:</p><pre><code class=\"rust\">extern \"C\" {\n    fn mapping_callback(\n        // These two parameters are always valid.\n        generated_line: u32,\n        generated_column: u32,\n\n        // The `last_generated_column` parameter is only valid if\n        // `has_last_generated_column` is `true`.\n        has_last_generated_column: bool,\n        last_generated_column: u32,\n\n        // The `source`, `original_line`, and `original_column`\n        // parameters are only valid if `has_original` is `true`.\n        has_original: bool,\n        source: u32,\n        original_line: u32,\n        original_column: u32,\n\n        // The `name` parameter is only valid if `has_name` is `true`.\n        has_name: bool,\n        name: u32,\n    );\n}\n\n#[inline]\nunsafe fn invoke_mapping_callback(mapping: &amp;Mapping) {\n    let generated_line = mapping.generated_line;\n    let generated_column = mapping.generated_column;\n\n    let (\n        has_last_generated_column,\n        last_generated_column,\n    ) = if let Some(last_generated_column) = mapping.last_generated_column {\n        (true, last_generated_column)\n    } else {\n        (false, 0)\n    };\n\n    let (\n        has_original,\n        source,\n        original_line,\n        original_column,\n        has_name,\n        name,\n    ) = if let Some(original) = mapping.original.as_ref() {\n        let (\n            has_name,\n            name,\n        ) = if let Some(name) = original.name {\n            (true, name)\n        } else {\n            (false, 0)\n        };\n\n        (\n            true,\n            original.source,\n            original.original_line,\n            original.original_column,\n            has_name,\n            name,\n        )\n    } else {\n        (\n            false,\n            0,\n            0,\n            0,\n            false,\n            0,\n        )\n    };\n\n    mapping_callback(\n        generated_line,\n        generated_column,\n        has_last_generated_column,\n        last_generated_column,\n        has_original,\n        source,\n        original_line,\n        original_column,\n        has_name,\n        name,\n    );\n}\n</code></pre><p>All of the exported query functions have a similar structure. They begin by converting a raw <code>*mut Mappings</code> pointer into an <code>&amp;mut Mappings</code> mutable reference. The <code>&amp;mut Mappings</code> lifetime is constrained to the current scope to enforce that it is only used in this function call, and not saved away somewhere where it might be used after it is deallocated. Next, the exported query function forwards the query to the corresponding <code>Mappings</code> method. For each resulting <code>Mapping</code>, the exported function invokes the <code>mapping_callback</code>.</p><p>A typical example is the exported <code>all_generated_locations_for</code> query function, which wraps the <code>Mappings::all_generated_locations_for</code> method, and finds all the mappings corresponding to the given original source location:</p><pre><code class=\"rust\">#[inline]\nunsafe fn mappings_mut&lt;'a>(\n    _scope: &amp;'a (),\n    mappings: *mut Mappings,\n) -> &amp;'a mut Mappings {\n    mappings.as_mut().unwrap()\n}\n\n#[no_mangle]\npub extern \"C\" fn all_generated_locations_for(\n    mappings: *mut Mappings,\n    source: u32,\n    original_line: u32,\n    has_original_column: bool,\n    original_column: u32,\n) {\n    let this_scope = ();\n    let mappings = unsafe { mappings_mut(&amp;this_scope, mappings) };\n\n    let original_column = if has_original_column {\n        Some(original_column)\n    } else {\n        None\n    };\n\n    let results = mappings.all_generated_locations_for(\n        source,\n        original_line,\n        original_column,\n    );\n    for m in results {\n        unsafe {\n            invoke_mapping_callback(m);\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre><p>Finally, when the JavaScript is finished querying the <code>Mappings</code>, it must deallocate them with the exported <code>free_mappings</code> function:</p><pre><code class=\"rust\">#[no_mangle]\npub extern \"C\" fn free_mappings(mappings: *mut Mappings) {\n    unsafe {\n        Box::from_raw(mappings);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre><h3><span id=\"compiling-rust-into-wasm-files\"></span> Compiling Rust into <code>.wasm</code> Files</h3><p>The addition of the <code>wasm32-unknown-unknown</code> target makes compiling Rust into WebAssembly possible, and <code>rustup</code> makes installing a Rust compiler toolchain targeting <code>wasm32-unknown-unknown</code> easy:</p><pre><code>$ rustup update\n$ rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown\n</code></pre><p>Now that we have a <code>wasm32-unknown-unknown</code> compiler, the only difference between building for our host platform and WebAssembly is a <code>--target</code> flag:</p><pre><code>$ cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown\n</code></pre><p>The resulting <code>.wasm</code> file is at <code>target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/source_map_mappings_wasm_api.wasm</code>.</p><p>Although we now have a working <code>.wasm</code> file, we are not finished: this <code>.wasm</code> file is still much larger than it needs to be.

The <code>source-map</code> library is primarily used in three environments:</p><ol><li>Node.js</li><li>The Web</li><li>Inside Firefox Developer Tools</li></ol><p>Different environments can have different methods for loading a <code>.wasm</code> file&rsquo;s bytes into an <code>ArrayBuffer</code> that can then be compiled by the JavaScript runtime. On the Web and inside Firefox, we can use the standard <code>fetch</code> API to make an HTTP request to load the <code>.wasm</code> file. It is the library consumer&rsquo;s responsibility to provide a URL pointing to the <code>.wasm</code> file before parsing any source maps. When used with Node.js, the library uses the <code>fs.readFile</code> API to read the <code>.wasm</code> file from disk. No initialization is required before parsing any source maps in this scenario. We provide a uniform interface regardless which environment the library is loaded in by using feature detection to select the correct <code>.wasm</code> loading implementation.</p><p>When compiling and instantiating the WebAssembly module, we must provide the <code>mapping_callback</code>. This callback cannot change across the lifetime of the instantiated WebAssembly module, but depending on what kind of query we are performing, we want to do different things with the resulting mappings. So the actual <code>mapping_callback</code> we provide is only responsible for translating the exploded mapping members into a structured object and then trampolining that result to a closure function that we set depending on what query we are running.</p><pre><code class=\"javascript\">let currentCallback = null;\n\n// ...\n\nWebAssembly.instantiate(buffer, {\n  env: {\n    mapping_callback: function (\n      generatedLine,\n      generatedColumn,\n\n      hasLastGeneratedColumn,\n      lastGeneratedColumn,\n\n      hasOriginal,\n      source,\n      originalLine,\n      originalColumn,\n\n      hasName,\n      name\n    ) {\n      const mapping = new Mapping;\n      mapping.generatedLine = generatedLine;\n      mapping.generatedColumn = generatedColumn;\n\n      if (hasLastGeneratedColumn) {\n        mapping.lastGeneratedColumn = lastGeneratedColumn;\n      }\n\n      if (hasOriginal) {\n        mapping.source = source;\n        mapping.originalLine = originalLine;\n        mapping.originalColumn = originalColumn;\n\n        if (hasName) {\n          mapping.name = name;\n        }\n      }\n\n      currentCallback(mapping);\n    }\n  }\n})\n</code></pre><p>To make setting and unsetting the <code>currentCallback</code> ergonomic, we define a <code>withMappingCallback</code> helper that takes two functions: one to set as the <code>currentCallback</code>, and another to invoke immediately. Once the second function&rsquo;s execution finishes, we reset the <code>currentCallback</code> to <code>null</code>. This is the JavaScript equivalent of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_acquisition_is_initialization\">RAII</a>:</p><pre><code class=\"javascript\">function withMappingCallback(mappingCallback, f) {\n  currentCallback = mappingCallback;\n  try {\n    f();\n  } finally {\n    currentCallback = null;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre><p>Recall that JavaScript&rsquo;s first task, when parsing a source map, is to tell the WebAssembly to allocate space for the <code>\"mappings\"</code> string, and then copy the string into the allocated buffer:</p><pre><code class=\"javascript\">const size = mappingsString.length;\nconst mappingsBufPtr = this._wasm.exports.allocate_mappings(size);\nconst mappingsBuf = new Uint8Array(\n  this._wasm.exports.memory.buffer,\n  mappingsBufPtr,\n  size\n);\nfor (let i = 0; i &lt; size; i++) {\n  mappingsBuf[i] = mappingsString.charCodeAt(i);\n}\n</code></pre><p>Once JavaScript has initialized the buffer, it calls the exported <code>parse_mappings</code> WebAssembly function and translates any failures into an <code>Error</code> that gets <code>throw</code>n.</p><pre><code class=\"javascript\">const mappingsPtr = this._wasm.exports.parse_mappings(mappingsBufPtr);\nif (!mappingsPtr) {\n  const error = this._wasm.exports.get_last_error();\n  let msg = `Error parsing mappings (code ${error}): `;\n  // XXX: keep these error codes in sync with `fitzgen/source-map-mappings`.\n  switch (error) {\n    case 1:\n      msg += \"the mappings contained a negative line, column, source index or name index\";\n      break;\n    case 2:\n      msg += \"the mappings contained a number larger than 2**32\";\n      break;\n    case 3:\n      msg += \"reached EOF while in the middle of parsing a VLQ\";\n      break;\n    case 4:\n      msg += \"invalid base 64 character while parsing a VLQ\";\n      break\n    default:\n      msg += \"unknown error code\";\n      break;\n  }\n\n  throw new Error(msg);\n}\n\nthis._mappingsPtr = mappingsPtr;\n</code></pre><p>The various query methods that call into WebAssembly have similar structure, just like the exported functions on the Rust side do. They validate query parameters, set up a temporary mappings callback closure with <code>withMappingCallback</code> that aggregates results, calls into WebAssembly, and then returns the results.</p><p>Here is what <code>allGeneratedPositionsFor</code> looks like in JavaScript:</p><pre><code class=\"javascript\">BasicSourceMapConsumer.prototype.allGeneratedPositionsFor = function ({\n  source,\n  line,\n  column,\n}) {\n  const hasColumn = column === undefined;\n  column = column || 0;\n\n  source = this._findSourceIndex(source);\n  if (source &lt; 0) {\n    return [];\n  }\n\n  if (originalLine &lt; 1) {\n    throw new Error(\"Line numbers must be >= 1\");\n  }\n\n  if (originalColumn &lt; 0) {\n    throw new Error(\"Column numbers must be >= 0\");\n  }\n\n  const results = [];\n\n  this._wasm.withMappingCallback(\n    m => {\n      let lastColumn = m.lastGeneratedColumn;\n      if (this._computedColumnSpans &amp;&amp; lastColumn === null) {\n        lastColumn = Infinity;\n      }\n      results.push({\n        line: m.generatedLine,\n        column: m.generatedColumn,\n        lastColumn,\n      });\n    }, () => {\n      this._wasm.exports.all_generated_locations_for(\n        this._getMappingsPtr(),\n        source,\n        line,\n        hasColumn,\n        column\n      );\n    }\n  );\n\n  return results;\n};\n</code></pre><p>When JavaScript is done querying the source map, the library consumer should call <code>SourceMapConsumer.prototype.destroy</code> which then calls into the exported <code>free_mappings</code> WebAssembly function:</p><pre><code class=\"javascript\">BasicSourceMapConsumer.prototype.destroy = function () {\n  if (this._mappingsPtr !== 0) {\n    this._wasm.exports.free_mappings(this._mappingsPtr);\n    this._mappingsPtr = 0;\n  }\n};\n</code></pre><h2><span id=\"benchmarks\"></span> Benchmarks</h2><p>All tests were performed on a MacBook Pro from mid 2014 with a 2.8 GHz Intel Core i7 processor and 16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3 memory. The laptop was plugged into power for every test, and the benchmark Webpage was refreshed between tests. The tests were performed in Chrome Canary 65.0.3322.0, Firefox Nightly 59.0a1 (2018-01-15), and Safari 11.0.2 (11604.4.7.1.6)<sup id=\"back-foot-3\"><a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/01/oxidizing-source-maps-with-rust-and-webassembly/#foot-3\">3</a></sup>. For each benchmark, to warm up the browser&rsquo;s JIT compiler, we performed five iterations before collecting timings. After warm up, we recorded timings for 100 iterations.</p><p>We used a variety of input source maps with our benchmarks. We used three source maps found in the wild of varying sizes:</p><ol><li>The <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/source-map/blob/2c6fb7e30bae18d7213a721c2854cb24a84cab04/dist/source-map.min.js.map\">source map for the minified-to-unminified</a> versions of the original JavaScript implementation of the <code>source-map</code> library. This source map is created by <a href=\"https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2\">UglifyJS</a> and its <code>\"mappings\"</code> string is 30,081 characters long.<p></p></li><li><p>The <a href=\"https://code.angularjs.org/latest/\">latest Angular.JS&rsquo;s minified-to-unminified source map</a>. This source map&rsquo;s <code>\"mappings\"</code> string is 391,473 characters long.</p></li><li><p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/source-map/blob/master/bench/scalajs-runtime-sourcemap.js\">Scala.JS runtime&rsquo;s Scala-to-JavaScript source map</a>. This source map is the largest, and its <code>\"mappings\"</code> string is 14,964,446 characters long.</p></li></ol><p>Additionally, we augmented the input set with two more artificially constructed source maps:</p><ol><li>The Angular.JS source map inflated to ten times its original size. This results in a <code>\"mappings\"</code> string of size 3,914,739.<p></p></li><li><p>The Scala.JS source map inflated to twice its original size. This results in a <code>\"mappings\"</code> string of size 29,928,893. For this input source map, we only collected 40 iterations on each benchmark.</p></li></ol><p>Astute readers will have noticed an extra 9 and 1 characters in the inflated source maps&rsquo; sizes respectively. These are from the <code>;</code> separator characters between each copy of the original <code>\"mappings\"</code> string when gluing them together to create the inflated version.</p><p>We will pay particular attention to the Scala.JS source map. It is the largest non-artificial source map we tested. Additionally, it is the largest source map for which we have measurements for all combinations of browser and library implementation. There is no data for the largest input (the twice inflated Scala.JS source map) on Chrome. With the JavaScript implementation, we were unable to take any measurements with this combination because none of the benchmarks could complete without the tab&rsquo;s content process crashing. With the WebAssembly implementation, Chrome would erroneously throw <code>RuntimeError: memory access out of bounds</code>. Using Chrome&rsquo;s debugger, the supposed out-of-bounds access was happening in an instruction sequence that does not exist in the <code>.wasm</code> file. All other browser&rsquo;s WebAssembly implementations successfully ran the benchmark with this input, so I am inclined to believe it is a bug in the Chrome implementation.</p><p><strong>For all benchmarks, lower values are better.</strong></p><h3><span id=\"setting-a-breakpoint-for-the-first-time\"></span> Setting a Breakpoint for the First Time</h3><p>The first benchmark simulates a stepping debugger setting a breakpoint on some line in the original source for the first time. This requires that the source map&rsquo;s <code>\"mappings\"</code> string is parsed, and that the parsed mappings are sorted by their original source locations so we can binary search to the breakpoint&rsquo;s line&rsquo;s mappings. The query returns every generated JavaScript location that corresponds to any mapping on the original source line.</p><p><a title=\"Setting a Breakpoint for the First Time (Mappings String Size vs. Time)\" href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/set.first_.breakpoint.mean_.png\"><img src=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/set.first_.breakpoint.mean_.png\"/><img/></a></p><p><a title=\"Setting a Breakpoint for the First Time (Scala.JS Source Map)\" href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/set.first_.breakpoint.scalajs.png\"><img src=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/set.first_.breakpoint.scalajs.png\"/><img/></a></p><p>The WebAssembly implementation outperforms its JavaScript counterpart in all browsers. For the Scala.JS source map, the WebAssembly implementation takes 0.65x the amount of time its JavaScript counterpart takes in Chrome, 0.30x in Firefox, and 0.37x in Safari. The WebAssembly implementation is fastest in Safari, taking 702ms on average compared to Chrome&rsquo;s 1140ms and Firefox&rsquo;s 877ms.</p><p>Furthermore, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_variation\">relative standard deviation</a> of the WebAssembly implementation is more narrow than the JavaScript implementation, particularly in Firefox. For the Scala.JS source map with the JavaScript implementation, Chrome&rsquo;s relative standard deviation is &plusmn;4.07%, Firefox&rsquo;s is &plusmn;10.52%, and Safari&rsquo;s is &plusmn;6.02%. In WebAssembly, the spreads shrink down to &plusmn;1.74% in Chrome, &plusmn;2.44% in Firefox, and &plusmn;1.58% in Safari.</p><h3><span id=\"pausing-at-an-exception-for-the-first-time\"></span> Pausing at an Exception for the First Time</h3><p>The second benchmark exercises the code path for the first time that a generated JavaScript location is used to look up its corresponding original source location. This happens when a stepping debugger pauses at an uncaught exception originating from within the generated JavaScript code, when a console message is logged from within the generated JavaScript code, or when stepping into the generated JavaScript code from some other JavaScript source.</p><p>To translate a generated JavaScript location into an original source location, the <code>\"mappings\"</code> string must be parsed. The parsed mappings must then be sorted by generated JavaScript location, so that we can binary search for the closest mapping, and finally that closest mapping&rsquo;s original source location is returned.</p><p><a title=\"Pausing at an Exception for the First Time (Mappings String Size vs. Time)\" href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/first.pause_.at_.exception.mean_.png\"><img src=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/first.pause_.at_.exception.mean_.png\"/><img/></a></p><p><a title=\"Pausing at an Exception for the First Time (Scala.JS Source Map)\" href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/first.pause_.at_.exception.scalajs.png\"><img src=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/first.pause_.at_.exception.scalajs.png\"/><img/></a></p><p>Once again, the WebAssembly implementation outperforms the JavaScript implementation in all browsers &mdash; by an even larger lead this time. With the Scala.JS source map, in Chrome, the WebAssembly implementation takes 0.23x the amount time that the JavaScript implementation takes. In both Firefox and Safari, the WebAssembly takes 0.17x the time the JavaScript takes. Once more, Safari runs the WebAssembly fastest (305ms), followed by Firefox (397ms), and then Chrome (486ms).</p><p>The WebAssembly implementation is also less noisy than the JavaScript implementation again. The relative standard deviations fell from &plusmn;4.04% to 2.35&plusmn;% in Chrome, from &plusmn;13.75% to &plusmn;2.03% in Firefox, and from &plusmn;6.65% to &plusmn;3.86% in Safari for the Scala.JS source map input.</p><h3><span id=\"subsequent-breakpoints-and-pauses-at-exceptions\"></span> Subsequent Breakpoints and Pauses at Exceptions</h3><p>The third and fourth benchmarks observe the time it takes to set subsequent breakpoints after the first one, or to pause at subsequent uncaught exceptions, or to translate subsequent logged messages&rsquo; locations. Historically, these operations have never been a performance bottleneck: the expensive part is the initial <code>\"mappings\"</code> string parse and construction of queryable data structures (the sorted arrays).</p><p>Nevertheless, we want to make sure it <em>stays</em> that way: we don&rsquo;t want these operations to suddenly become costly.</p><p>Both of these benchmarks are measuring the time it takes to binary search for the closest mapping to the target location and returning that mapping&rsquo;s co-location.</p><p><a title=\"Setting Subsequent Breakpoints (Mappings String Size vs. Time)\" class=\"inline\" href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/subsequent.setting.breakpoints.mean_.png\"><img src=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/subsequent.setting.breakpoints.mean_.png\"/><img/></a><a title=\"Setting Subsequent Breakpoints (Scala.JS Source Map)\" class=\"inline\" href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/subsequent.setting.breakpoints.scalajs.png\"><img src=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/subsequent.setting.breakpoints.scalajs.png\"/><img/></a></p><p><a title=\"Subsequent Pausing at Exceptions (Mappings String Size vs. Time)\" class=\"inline\" href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/subsequent.pausing.at_.exceptions.mean_.png\"><img src=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/subsequent.pausing.at_.exceptions.mean_.png\"/><img/></a><a title=\"Subsequent Pausing at Exceptions (Scala.JS Source Map)\" class=\"inline\" href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/subsequent.pausing.at_.exceptions.scalajs.png\"><img src=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/subsequent.pausing.at_.exceptions.scalajs.png\"/><img/></a></p><p>These benchmark results should be seasoned with more salt than the other benchmarks&rsquo; results. Looking at both of the Scala.JS source map input plots, we see clear strata formations. This layering happens because the benchmarked operations run in such little time that the resolution of our timer becomes visible. We can see that Chrome exposes timers with resolution to tenths of a millisecond, Firefox exposes them with resolution to .02 milliseconds, and Safari exposes millisecond resolution.</p><p>All we can conclude, based on this data, is that subsequent queries largely remain sub-millisecond operations in both JavaScript and WebAssembly implementations. Subsequent queries have never been a performance bottleneck, and they do not become a bottleneck in the new WebAssembly implementation.</p><h3><span id=\"iterating-over-all-mappings\"></span> Iterating Over All Mappings</h3><p>The final two benchmarks measure the time it takes to parse a source map and immediately iterate over its mappings, and to iterate over an already-parsed source map&rsquo;s mappings. These are common operations performed by build tools that are composing or consuming source maps. They are also sometimes performed by stepping debuggers to highlight to the user which lines within an original source the user can set breakpoints on &mdash; it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to set a breakpoint on a line that doesn&rsquo;t translate into any location in the generated JavaScript.</p><p>This benchmark was the one we worried about: it involves the most JavaScript<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/2194.png\" alt=\"&harr;\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\"/><img/>WebAssembly boundary crossing, an FFI call for every mapping in the source map. For all other benchmarks tested, our design minimized the number of such FFI calls.</p><p><a title=\"Parse and Iterate Each Mapping (Mappings String Size vs. Time)\" class=\"inline\" href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/parse.and_.iterate.mean_.png\"><img src=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/parse.and_.iterate.mean_.png\"/><img/></a><a title=\"Parse and Iterate Each Mapping (Scala.JS Source Map)\" class=\"inline\" href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/parse.and_.iterate.scalajs.png\"><img src=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/parse.and_.iterate.scalajs.png\"/><img/></a></p><p><a title=\"Already Parsed, Iterate Each Mapping (Mappings String Size vs. Time)\" class=\"inline\" href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/iterate.already.parsed.mean_.png\"><img src=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/iterate.already.parsed.mean_.png\"/><img/></a><a title=\"Already Parsed, Iterate Each Mapping (Scala.JS Source Map)\" class=\"inline\" href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/iterate.already.parsed.scalajs.png\"><img src=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/iterate.already.parsed.scalajs.png\"/><img/></a></p><p>It turns out our worry was unfounded. The WebAssembly implementation doesn&rsquo;t just meet the JavaScript implementation&rsquo;s performance, even when the source map is already parsed, it surpasses the JavaScript implementation&rsquo;s performance. For the parse-and-iterate and iterate-already-parsed benchmarks, the WebAssembly takes 0.61x and 0.71x the time of the JavaScript in Chrome. In Firefox, the WebAssembly takes 0.56x and 0.77x the time of the JavaScript. In Safari, the WebAssembly implementation takes 0.63x and 0.87x the amount of time that the JavaScript implementation takes. Once again, Safari runs the WebAssembly implementation the quickest, and Firefox and Chrome are essentially tied for second place. Safari deserves special acknowledgment for its JavaScript performance on the iterate-already-parsed benchmark: beyond just outperforming the other browsers&rsquo; JavaScript times, Safari runs the JavaScript faster than the other browsers run the WebAssembly!</p><p>True to the trend from earlier benchmarks, we also see reductions in the relative standard deviations in the WebAssembly compared to the JavaScript implementation. When both parsing and iterating, Chrome&rsquo;s relative standard deviation fell from &plusmn;1.80% to &plusmn;0.33%, Firefox&rsquo;s from &plusmn;11.63% to &plusmn;1.41%, and Safari&rsquo;s from &plusmn;2.73% to &plusmn;1.51%. When iterating over an already-parsed source map&rsquo;s mappings, Firefox&rsquo;s relative standard deviation dropped from &plusmn;12.56% to &plusmn;1.40%, and Safari&rsquo;s from &plusmn;1.97% to &plusmn;1.40%. Chrome&rsquo;s relative standard deviation grew from &plusmn;0.61% to &plusmn;1.18%, making it the only browser to buck the trend, but only on this one benchmark.</p><h3><span id=\"code-size\"></span> Code Size</h3><p>One of advantages of the <code>wasm32-unknown-unknown</code> target over the <code>wasm32-unknown-emscripten</code> target, is that it generates leaner WebAssembly code. The <code>wasm32-unknown-emscripten</code> target includes polyfills for most of <code>libc</code> and a file system built on top of <code>IndexedDB</code>, among other things, but <code>wasm32-unknown-unknown</code> does not. With the <code>source-map</code> library, we&rsquo;ve only used <code>wasm32-unknown-unknown</code>.</p><p>We consider the code size of the JavaScript and WebAssembly that is delivered to the client. That is, we&rsquo;re looking at the code size after bundling JavaScript modules together into a single <code>.js</code> file. We look at the effects of using <code>wasm-gc</code>, <code>wasm-snip</code>, and <code>wasm-opt</code> to shrink <code>.wasm</code> file size, and using <code>gzip</code> compression, which is ubiquitously supported on the Web.</p><p>In these measurements, the JavaScript size reported is always the size of minified JavaScript, created with the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler\">Google Closure Compiler</a> at the &ldquo;simple&rdquo; optimization level. We used the Closure Compiler because UglifyJS does not support some newer ECMAScript forms that we introduced (for example <code>let</code> and arrow functions). We used the &ldquo;simple&rdquo; optimization level because the &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; optimization level is destructive for JavaScript that wasn&rsquo;t authored with Closure Compiler in mind.</p><p>The bars labeled &ldquo;JavaScript&rdquo; are for variations of the original, pure-JavaScript <code>source-map</code> library implementation. The bars labeled &ldquo;WebAssembly&rdquo; are for variations of the new <code>source-map</code> library implementation that uses WebAssembly for parsing the <code>\"mappings\"</code> string and querying the parsed mappings. Note that the &ldquo;WebAssembly&rdquo; implementation still uses JavaScript for all other functionality! The <code>source-map</code> library has additional features, such as generating source maps, that are still implemented in JavaScript. For the &ldquo;WebAssembly&rdquo; implementation, we report the sizes of both the WebAssembly and JavaScript.</p><p><a title=\"Code Size by Implementation and Build\" href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/size.png\"><img src=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/size.png\"/><img/></a></p><p>At its smallest, the new WebAssembly implementation has a larger total code size than the old JavaScript implementation: 20,996 bytes versus 8,365 bytes respectively. However, by using tools for shrinking <code>.wasm</code> size, we brought the size of the WebAssembly down to 0.16x its original size. Both implementations have similar amounts of JavaScript.</p><p>If we replaced JavaScript parsing and querying code with WebAssembly, why doesn&rsquo;t the WebAssembly implementation contain less JavaScript? There are two factors contributing to the lack of JavaScript code size reductions. First, there is some small amount of new JavaScript introduced to load the <code>.wasm</code> file and interface with the WebAssembly. Second, and more importantly, some of the JavaScript routines that we &ldquo;replaced&rdquo; were previously shared with other parts of the <code>source-map</code> library. Now, although those routines are no longer shared, they are still in use by those other portions of the library.</p><p>Let us turn our focus towards what is contributing to the size of the pre-<code>gzip</code>ed <code>.wasm</code> file. Running <code>wasm-objdump -h</code> gives us the sizes of each section:</p><p><a title=\"WebAssembly Size by Section\" href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/section-sizes.png\"><img src=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/section-sizes.png\"/><img/></a></p><p>The <code>Code</code> and <code>Data</code> sections effectively account for the whole <code>.wasm</code> file&rsquo;s size. The <code>Code</code> section contains the encoded WebAssembly instructions that make up function bodies. The <code>Data</code> section consists of static data to be loaded into the WebAssembly module&rsquo;s linear memory space.</p><p>Using <code>wasm-objdump</code> to manually inspect the <code>Data</code> section&rsquo;s contents shows that it mostly consists of string fragments used for constructing diagnostic messages if the Rust code were to panic. However, when targeting WebAssembly, Rust panics translate into WebAssembly traps, and traps do not carry extra diagnostic information. We consider it a bug in <code>rustc</code> that these string fragments are even emitted. Unfortunately, <code>wasm-gc</code> cannot currently remove unused <code>Data</code> segments either, so we are stuck with this bloat for the meantime. WebAssembly and its tooling is still relatively immature, and we expect the toolchain to improve in this respect with time.</p><p>Next, we post-process <code>wasm-objdump</code>&lsquo;s disassembly output to compute the size of each function body inside the <code>Code</code> section, and group sizes by Rust crate:</p><p><a title=\"Code Size by Crate\" href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/crate-size.png\"><img src=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/crate-size.png\"/><img/></a></p><p>The heaviest crate is <code>dlmalloc</code> which is used by the <code>alloc</code> crate, which implements Rust&rsquo;s low-level allocation APIs. Together, <code>dlmalloc</code> and <code>alloc</code> clock in at 10,126 bytes, or 50.98% the total function size. In a sense, this is a relief: the code size of the allocator is a constant that will not grow as we port more JavaScript code to Rust.</p><p>The sum of code sizes from crates that we authored (<code>vlq</code>, <code>source_map_mappings</code>, and <code>source_map_mappings_wasm_api</code>) is 9,320 bytes, or 46.92% the total function size. That leaves only 417 bytes (2.10%) of space consumed by the other crates. This speaks to the efficacy of <code>wasm-gc</code>, <code>wasm-snip</code>, and <code>wasm-opt</code>: although crates like <code>std</code> are <em>much</em> larger than our crates, we only use a tiny fraction of its APIs and we only pay for what we use.</p><h2><span id=\"conclusions-and-future-work\"></span> Conclusions and Future Work</h2><p>Rewriting the most performance-sensitive portions of source map parsing and querying in Rust and WebAssembly has been a success. On our benchmarks, the WebAssembly implementation takes a fraction the time that the original JavaScript implementation takes &mdash; as little as 0.17x the time. We observe that, for all browsers, the WebAssembly implementation is faster than the JavaScript implementation. Furthermore, the WebAssembly implementation offers more consistent and reliable performance: relative standard deviation between iterations dropped significantly compared to the JavaScript implementation.</p><p>The JavaScript implementation has accumulated convoluted code in the name of performance, and we replaced it with idiomatic Rust. Rust does not force us to choose between clearly expressing intent and runtime performance.</p><p>That said, there is still more work to do.</p><p>The most pressing next step is investigating why the Rust standard library&rsquo;s sorting is not as fast as our custom Quicksort when targeting WebAssembly. This is the sole unidiomatic bit of Rust code in the rewrite. This behavior is surprising since our Quicksort implementation is naive, and the standard library&rsquo;s quick sort is pattern defeating and opportunistically uses insertion sort for small and mostly-sorted ranges. In fact, the standard library&rsquo;s sorting routine <em>is</em> faster than ours when targeting native code. We speculate that inlining heuristics are changing across targets, and that our comparator functions aren&rsquo;t being inlined into the standard library&rsquo;s sorting routine when targeting WebAssembly. It requires further investigation.</p><p>We found size profiling WebAssembly was more difficult than necessary. To get useful information presented meaningfully, we were forced to write <a href=\"https://github.com/fitzgen/source-map-mappings/blob/cfbb11e1af65b1e9c22bfe082c95f849e5812708/source-map-mappings-wasm-api/who-calls.py\">our own home-grown script to post-process <code>wasm-objdump</code></a>.  The script constructs the call graph, and lets us query who the callers of some function were, helping us understand why the function was emitted in the <code>.wasm</code> file, even if we didn&rsquo;t expect it to be. It is pretty hacky, and doesn&rsquo;t expose information about inlined functions. A proper WebAssembly size profiler would have helped, and would be a benefit for anyone following in our tracks.</p><p>The relatively large code size footprint of the allocator suggests that writing or adapting an allocator that is focused on tiny code size could provide considerable utility for the WebAssembly ecosystem. At least for our use case, allocator performance is not a concern, and we only make a small handful of dynamic allocations. For an allocator, we would choose small code size over performance in a heartbeat.</p><p>The unused segments in our <code>Data</code> section highlight the need for <code>wasm-gc</code>, or another tool, to detect and remove static data that is never referenced.</p><p>There are still some JavaScript API improvements that we can make for the library&rsquo;s downstream users. The introduction of WebAssembly in our current implementation requires the introduction of manually freeing the parsed mappings when the user is finished with it. This does not come naturally to most JavaScript programmers, who are used to relying on a garbage collector, and do not typically think about the lifetime of any particular object. We could introduce a <code>SourceMapConsumer.with</code> function that took a raw, un-parsed source map, and an <code>async</code> function. The <code>with</code> function would construct a <code>SourceMapConsumer</code> instance, invoke the <code>async</code> function with it, and then call <code>destroy</code> on the <code>SourceMapConsumer</code> instance once the <code>async</code> function call completes. This is like <code>async</code> RAII for JavaScript.</p><pre><code class=\"javascript\">SourceMapConsumer.with = async function (rawSourceMap, f) {\n  const consumer = await new SourceMapConsumer(rawSourceMap);\n  try {\n    await f(consumer);\n  } finally {\n    consumer.destroy();\n  }\n};\n</code></pre><p>Another alternative way to make the API easier to work with for JavaScript programmers would be to give every <code>SourceMapConsumer</code> its own instance of the WebAssembly module. Then, because the <code>SourceMapConsumer</code> instance would have the sole GC edge to its WebAssembly module instance, we could let the garbage collector manage all of the <code>SourceMapConsumer</code> instance, the WebAssembly module instance, and the module instance&rsquo;s heap. With this strategy, we would have a single <code>static mut MAPPINGS: Mappings</code> in the Rust WebAssembly glue code, and the <code>Mappings</code> instance would be implicit in all exported query function calls. No more <code>Box::new(mappings)</code> in the <code>parse_mappings</code> function, and no more passing around <code>*mut Mappings</code> pointers. With some care, we might be able to remove all allocation from the Rust library, which would shrink the emitted WebAssembly to half its current size. Of course, this all depends on creating multiple instances of the same WebAssembly module being a relatively cheap operation, which requires further investigation.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/alexcrichton/wasm-bindgen\"><code>wasm-bindgen</code></a> project aims to remove the need to write FFI glue code by hand, and automates interfacing between WebAssembly and JavaScript. Using it, we should be able to remove all the hand-written <code>unsafe</code> pointer manipulation code involved in exporting Rust APIs to JavaScript.</p><p>In this project, we ported source map parsing and querying to Rust and WebAssembly, but this is only half of the <code>source-map</code> library&rsquo;s functionality. The other half is generating source maps, and it is also performance sensitive. We would like to rewrite the core of building and encoding source maps in Rust and WebAssembly sometime in the future as well. We expect to see similar speed ups to what we observed for parsing source maps.</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/source-map/pull/306\">The pull request adding the WebAssembly implementation to the <code>mozilla/source-map</code> library is in the process of merging here.</a> That pull request contains the benchmarking code, so that results can be reproduced, and we can continue to improve them.</p><p>Finally, I&rsquo;d like to thank <a href=\"http://tromey.com\">Tom Tromey</a> for hacking on this project with me.

There&rsquo;s a <a href=\"https://jofftiquez.github.io/vue-stripe-checkout/\">repo and component for this</a>, but as easy as that is to implement (it's probably the most simple way to do it), I wanted a little more customization and wanted the checkout flow to be part of the page and application. This approach wouldn&rsquo;t work for my needs.</p><h3>Stripe Elements</h3><p>Stripe also offers a thing called <a href=\"https://stripe.com/elements\">Elements</a>. Elements allow you to integrate Stripe's payment system into your own checkout form and style it like your own site for a cohesive experience. It won't feel like you're using a third party plugin. They do have some <a href=\"https://stripe.github.io/elements-examples/\">pre-styled examples</a> if you prefer something you can use right out of the box.</p><p>Luckily for us, there's a really nice repo with a Vue version of Stripe Elements called <a href=\"https://github.com/fromAtoB/vue-stripe-elements\">vue-stripe-elements</a>. The repo's documentation is really nice, so you could check that out. Here's how I put it to use:</p><pre rel=\"Command Line\"><code>npm i vue-stripe-elements-plus --save</code></pre><p>...or using Yarn:</p><pre rel=\"Command Line\"><code>yarn add vue-stripe-elements-plus</code></pre><p>Now let's talk about our cart and integrate it.</p><h3>The Cart</h3><p>Here's what everything looks like as a birds eye view of the application.

If you're unfamiliar with Nuxt.js, it allows us to use <code>.vue</code> components as pages by creating them in this pages directory. We can still populate these pages with components from the components directory to create a more modular application.

        "description": "<p>About 2 weeks ago I did a &ldquo;quiet release&rdquo;, if you will, of <a href=\"https://goo.gl/tWF5HE\">my new book</a>: <em>A Curious Moon</em>. It&rsquo;s kind of a funky little venture, blending a bit of scifi with the real world concerns of a database administrator/analyst.</p><p>Ultimately, <strong>it&rsquo;s a book about data</strong>. How working with it on a daily basis requires you to be an intuitive sleuth as well as a pragmatic engineer, and how it can be <em>quite fun</em> as well!</p><h2>An Icy Moon That Might Have Life</h2><p><img src=\"https://rob.conery.io/wp-content/uploads/7796_PIA21346-full.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"834\" height=\"677\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1150\" srcset=\"https://rob.conery.io/wp-content/uploads/7796_PIA21346-full.jpg 834w, https://rob.conery.io/wp-content/uploads/7796_PIA21346-full-300x244.jpg 300w, https://rob.conery.io/wp-content/uploads/7796_PIA21346-full-768x623.jpg 768w, https://rob.conery.io/wp-content/uploads/7796_PIA21346-full-800x649.jpg 800w, https://rob.conery.io/wp-content/uploads/7796_PIA21346-full-310x252.jpg 310w, https://rob.conery.io/wp-content/uploads/7796_PIA21346-full-140x114.jpg 140w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 834px) 100vw, 834px\"/><img/></p><p>I started writing this book in September 2017 as a quick tutorial on PostgreSQL, my favorite database. I intended it to be about 100 pages or so, designed to be a highly-focused, quick read that you could do on moderate plane flight.</p><p>I wanted to focus on building a database that you could actually use, so I of course thought &ldquo;ECOMMERCE!&rdquo; because&hellip; why not. After a few weeks that grew rather boring, so I decided to have a look at a better data set.</p><p>It was right around this time that <a href=\"https://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/grand-finale/cassini-end-of-mission-timeline/\">Cassini plunged into Saturn</a> and I was reading article after article about the amazing things that Cassini discovered. One of those things was Enceladus, a freaky little moon that very well could be harboring life under its icy shell.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/excitement-builds-for-the-possibility-of-life-on-enceladus/\">story of the Enceladus investigation is astounding</a> and I was quickly wrapped up in what the Cassini team described as &ldquo;the greatest cosmic detective story of all time&rdquo;. I just had to use this as the backbone of the PostgreSQL book&hellip; but how?</p><h2>Inspired By The Martian</h2><p>Every bit of data from Cassini is public domain. NASA has 24 hours to release whatever they find, so all the data from Cassini is there for the taking. I downloaded about 200G of delicious space data, and I set about trying to figure out how to structure a basic PostgreSQL tutorial using it. Needless to say: <em>I was overwhelmed</em>.</p><p><strong>There is over 20 years of data</strong> from Cassini. TONS of readings from its 12 different instruments! In short: it just wasn&rsquo;t possible.</p><p><img src=\"https://rob.conery.io/wp-content/uploads/10.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"315\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1152\" srcset=\"https://rob.conery.io/wp-content/uploads/10.jpg 1000w, https://rob.conery.io/wp-content/uploads/10-300x95.jpg 300w, https://rob.conery.io/wp-content/uploads/10-768x242.jpg 768w, https://rob.conery.io/wp-content/uploads/10-800x252.jpg 800w, https://rob.conery.io/wp-content/uploads/10-310x98.jpg 310w, https://rob.conery.io/wp-content/uploads/10-140x44.jpg 140w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"/><img/></p><p>I then recalled an interview with Andy Weir, where <a href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/andy-weir-the-martian-science-crowdsourcing-2015-10?r=US&amp;IR=T\">he talked about</a> how he put together the story for <em>The Martian</em>:</p><blockquote><p>\nMy research created interesting plot points. Like when I researched potatoes and found out how much water he&rsquo;d (Watney) need in the soil. Then I realized he&rsquo;d have to make water. And that led to one of the coolest plots in the book&hellip;\n</p></blockquote><p>Basically: <em>he solved one problem at a time</em> and let the science drive the storyline. I figured I could do the same thing! Treat this as an investigation &ndash; the detective story that it truly is. Start at the beginning and let the data drive.</p><p>Doing this necessitated something more than me telling you all about Enceladus and Cassini &ndash; so I decided to create some fictional characters that work at my fictional startup, Red:4.</p><p>My main character, Dee Yan, is a newly-promoted DBA who has to assemble and normalize loads of Cassini data relative to Enceladus. She uses PostgreSQL to do this, and shares her code with you journal style.</p><p>She has some big wins and a few massive failures, but most importantly she learns how to spot her biases and focus clearly on what the data is telling her.</p><h2>The Most Fun I&rsquo;ve Ever Had</h2><p>I&rsquo;m not a fiction writer and this is the first time I&rsquo;ve ever tried something like this. So far the feedback has been incredibly positive! People enjoy reading about PostgreSQL, shell scripting and so on, having it all wrapped up in a fun story.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been telling people about it while I&rsquo;m here at NDC London, and quite a few had no idea that I wrote a new book! I announced it (sort of) <a href=\"https://medium.com/@robconery/adding-some-scifi-fun-to-a-book-about-databases-82825aca0b14\">on Medium</a>, but decided to pop it here as well, with a little more detail as to the content.</p><p>It was easily the most fun I&rsquo;ve ever had creating something. I hope that comes through! Working with data (especially using PostgreSQL) is so rewarding at times &ndash; it&rsquo;s quite different from writing code and building apps. You have to have some really solid detective skills to sniff out inconsistencies and also solid database skills to make sure the data is correct.</p><p>Hopefully that all comes across in the book, and if you&rsquo;re interested <a href=\"https://goo.gl/tWF5HE\">you can pick it up here</a>.</p><p><img src=\"https://rob.conery.io/wp-content/uploads/image-20170411-26720-1avikn7.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"754\" height=\"274\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1153\" srcset=\"https://rob.conery.io/wp-content/uploads/image-20170411-26720-1avikn7.jpg 754w, https://rob.conery.io/wp-content/uploads/image-20170411-26720-1avikn7-300x109.jpg 300w, https://rob.conery.io/wp-content/uploads/image-20170411-26720-1avikn7-310x113.jpg 310w, https://rob.conery.io/wp-content/uploads/image-20170411-26720-1avikn7-140x51.jpg 140w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 754px) 100vw, 754px\"/><img/></p>"

        "summary": "<div class=\"wrapper--narrow page-block\">\n  <div class=\"text\" data-module=\"Text\">\n    <p>In our last article, we explored reasons you might need a Design System and how they can help. If you’re interested in the promises a Design System can offer, you might be wondering if you need help and where to start. This article is written with that in mind.<br></p>\n<h2>Why hire an agency? Why not DIY?</h2>\n<p>It’s true that many large companies are beginning to address the need for Design Systems from within their organization. So, why work with an agency when you can start working on this yourself? Here are a few important reasons:</p>\n<h3>Scale </h3>\n<p>We can scale according to your needs&mdash;either by doing everything for you or by supplementing your in-house team. An agency has, by design, a diversity of roles&mdash;everything from UX, design, copywriting, and development. We have specialists who can consult on your work who you wouldn’t otherwise hire. Maybe you have developers but zero to few designers. Maybe your designers are already at capacity on internal projects or focused on other matters.</p>\n<h3>Timing</h3>\n<p>Hiring and ramping up a solid team is a lengthy process. An agency has a team that can begin immediately. We regularly adjust our long-term planning to account for schedule fluidity and can usually assemble a team quickly for pressing needs. If you need additional resources, it’s far more likely for us to have availability by someone winding down a project than for you to go through another long hiring cycle to find exceptional talent. </p>\n<h3>Quality</h3>\n<p>Before you commit to hiring more people it’s a good idea to work with people who know what they are doing. We have a system of accountability to ensure that the work we do is technically correct, extensible, and of a high caliber. We have high standards when it comes to recruiting and only hire the best. &nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Expertise</h3>\n<p>Maybe an agency has a reputation of being leaders or innovators in an emerging area for you. Within each area of expertise, we take time for professional development within our groups and as individuals. We believe in lifelong learning and continual growth. As an agency, we’re exposed to a variety of industries and companies that are at varying stages of growth. We pay attention to emerging technologies and invest time into learning more about the ones we believe in. </p>\n<h3>Advice</h3>\n<p>We can offer advice on how best to organize your assets and what to look for if you’re thinking of&nbsp;bringing expertise in-house more gradually. An agency may be better positioned to look at products and services across a large organization, whereas internal teams may be too focused on a single product or service to see the larger picture.</p>\n<h2>How do we get started?</h2>\n<p>Maybe you’re thinking you need a Design System but don’t really know where to start. As we see it, there are three primary entry points&mdash;evolving your existing system, revolutionizing with a redesign, or starting from scratch.</p>\n<h3>Evolution</h3>\n<p>If you’re a large organization that’s been operating in digital for years, there’s a good chance that you simply need to reverse engineer what you have into a better organized system. In this case, we typically start with an audit of your system to see what you have and look for patterns and inconsistencies. From here, we would take things into a fairly typical research, design, build, launch, analyze, and repeat lifecycle. In a case like this where we’re starting with what you already have, we’d recommend working in agile sprints that could coincide with your existing release cycles.</p>\n<h3>Revolution</h3>\n<p>Sometimes we’re faced with an opportunity to take what you have and completely revamp it&mdash;often referred to as a redesign. This is often the biggest lift because it involves research to better understand what got you to where you are and where you’d like to go from here. Sometimes it’s as simple as a reskin&mdash;a focus on improving the look and feel without thinking more strategically about the possibilities. Preferably, we’re also helping you with your objectives to better help you tie everything back to your vision and mission, positioning, and messaging with great thought, care, and detail put into your look and feel as well as your voice and tone. In this case, we recommend a more strategic approach which would likely involve staggered sprints based on milestones catered to your needs. </p>\n<h3>Creation</h3>\n<p>If you’re a smaller organization just starting out, we’d likely go through a slightly different process. We wouldn’t necessarily need an audit of your existing system, but we’d still want to do proper research to get to know you and your competitive advantages better. It’s likely in this scenario that we’d spend more exploratory time up front to figure out what would work best for you.

        "description": "<div class=\"wrapper--narrow page-block\"><div class=\"text\" data-module=\"Text\"><p>In our last article, we explored reasons you might need a Design System and how they can help. If you&rsquo;re interested in the promises a Design System can offer, you might be wondering if you need help and where to start. This article is written with that in mind.<br/></p><h2>Why hire an agency? Why not DIY?</h2><p>It&rsquo;s true that many large companies are beginning to address the need for Design Systems from within their organization. So, why work with an agency when you can start working on this yourself? Here are a few important reasons:</p><h3>Scale </h3><p>We can scale according to your needs&mdash;either by doing everything for you or by supplementing your in-house team. An agency has, by design, a diversity of roles&mdash;everything from UX, design, copywriting, and development. We have specialists who can consult on your work who you wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise hire. Maybe you have developers but zero to few designers. Maybe your designers are already at capacity on internal projects or focused on other matters.</p><h3>Timing</h3><p>Hiring and ramping up a solid team is a lengthy process. An agency has a team that can begin immediately. We regularly adjust our long-term planning to account for schedule fluidity and can usually assemble a team quickly for pressing needs. If you need additional resources, it&rsquo;s far more likely for us to have availability by someone winding down a project than for you to go through another long hiring cycle to find exceptional talent. </p><h3>Quality</h3><p>Before you commit to hiring more people it&rsquo;s a good idea to work with people who know what they are doing. We have a system of accountability to ensure that the work we do is technically correct, extensible, and of a high caliber. We have high standards when it comes to recruiting and only hire the best. &nbsp;</p><h3>Expertise</h3><p>Maybe an agency has a reputation of being leaders or innovators in an emerging area for you. Within each area of expertise, we take time for professional development within our groups and as individuals. We believe in lifelong learning and continual growth. As an agency, we&rsquo;re exposed to a variety of industries and companies that are at varying stages of growth. We pay attention to emerging technologies and invest time into learning more about the ones we believe in. </p><h3>Advice</h3><p>We can offer advice on how best to organize your assets and what to look for if you&rsquo;re thinking of&nbsp;bringing expertise in-house more gradually. An agency may be better positioned to look at products and services across a large organization, whereas internal teams may be too focused on a single product or service to see the larger picture.</p><h2>How do we get started?</h2><p>Maybe you&rsquo;re thinking you need a Design System but don&rsquo;t really know where to start. As we see it, there are three primary entry points&mdash;evolving your existing system, revolutionizing with a redesign, or starting from scratch.</p><h3>Evolution</h3><p>If you&rsquo;re a large organization that&rsquo;s been operating in digital for years, there&rsquo;s a good chance that you simply need to reverse engineer what you have into a better organized system. In this case, we typically start with an audit of your system to see what you have and look for patterns and inconsistencies. From here, we would take things into a fairly typical research, design, build, launch, analyze, and repeat lifecycle. In a case like this where we&rsquo;re starting with what you already have, we&rsquo;d recommend working in agile sprints that could coincide with your existing release cycles.</p><h3>Revolution</h3><p>Sometimes we&rsquo;re faced with an opportunity to take what you have and completely revamp it&mdash;often referred to as a redesign. This is often the biggest lift because it involves research to better understand what got you to where you are and where you&rsquo;d like to go from here. Sometimes it&rsquo;s as simple as a reskin&mdash;a focus on improving the look and feel without thinking more strategically about the possibilities. Preferably, we&rsquo;re also helping you with your objectives to better help you tie everything back to your vision and mission, positioning, and messaging with great thought, care, and detail put into your look and feel as well as your voice and tone. In this case, we recommend a more strategic approach which would likely involve staggered sprints based on milestones catered to your needs. </p><h3>Creation</h3><p>If you&rsquo;re a smaller organization just starting out, we&rsquo;d likely go through a slightly different process. We wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily need an audit of your existing system, but we&rsquo;d still want to do proper research to get to know you and your competitive advantages better. It&rsquo;s likely in this scenario that we&rsquo;d spend more exploratory time up front to figure out what would work best for you. For this, we&rsquo;d recommend more of a milestone approach to the design to better cater to you seeing things for the first time. </p><h3>Extension</h3><p>There's one more area to consider where it might make sense to get help. It's possible you already have a good Design System in place. Where you could be facing challenges is in extending that system further. Maybe you don't have capacity or the right people right now to take what you have and apply it further at the speed you would like. In a case like this, it would be natural for an agency to help you. While we may not be educated about your system out of the gate, we've worked with other companies and their systems and can be quick studies to understand what you have and how to scale in accordance with the system. We can also advise on how to leverage the system to tackle new problems that emerge.&nbsp;</p><h2>What goes into a Design System?</h2><p>These are just some examples of how an agency, like Viget, will evaluate your needs to know how best to help and where to begin.

        "description": "<p>Since part 4 of this series, a lot has changed with the US FinTech landscape that enables companies like <a href=\"https://gusto.com/\">Gusto</a> to move money safely and speedily. In this part, we will look at some recent developments announced by NACHA, specifically around Same Day ACH. <br/>\nBefore we get going, make sure to refresh your memory on ACH basics and lingo from <a href=\"https://engineering.gusto.com/how-ach-works-a-developer-perspective-part-1/\">part 1</a>, as well as on ACH timing from <a href=\"https://engineering.gusto.com/how-ach-works-a-developer-perspective-part-3/\">part 3</a>.  </p><h2 id=\"sowhatsnew\">So what&rsquo;s new?</h2><p>Same day ACH is a set of rules which give the option to ODFIs to transact money (debits or credits) and mandate RDFIs to settle funds on the same banking day. This theoretically allows Originators and Receivers to be able to send and receive funds within the same day. <br/>\nIn September 2016, <a href=\"https://www.nacha.org/rules/same-day-ach-moving-payments-faster\">Phase 1</a> of NACHA&rsquo;s Same Day ACH rules became effective, allowing same day credits. <br/>\nIn September 2017, <a href=\"https://www.nacha.org/rules/same-day-ach-moving-payments-faster-phase-2\">Phase 2</a> was rolled out for debits.  </p><p>These enhancements come with some caveats, so let&rsquo;s see if same day ACH is right for you:</p><h3 id=\"regularachtimingalltimesinpt\">Regular ACH timing (all times in PT):</h3><p><img src=\"https://engineering.gusto.com/content/images/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2014-07-08-at-4-50-38-PM.png\" alt=\"\"/></p><h3 id=\"samedayachtiming\">Same Day ACH timing:</h3><p>Leg 2 and Leg 3 can now happen sooner on Day 1. There are 2 new windows for the ODFI to forward the ACH request to the Fed (and the RDFI) and for the RDFI to settle the funds.</p><p><em>Window 1:</em> Fed receives ACH request by 7.30am PT, RDFI settles funds by 10am PT <br/><em>Window 2:</em> Fed receives ACH request by 11:45am PT, funds settled by 2pm PT</p><p>In addition, with <a href=\"https://www.nacha.org/rules/same-day-ach-moving-payments-faster-phase-3\">Phase 3</a> in March 2018, the rules mandate RDFIs to make funds available to Receivers by 5pm RDFI&rsquo;s local time.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s what the same day ACH timeline looks like for Window 2 (all times in PT) <br/><img src=\"http://engineering.gusto.com/content/images/2018/01/Screenshot-2018-01-17-16.58.22-1.png\" alt=\"\"/></p><h2 id=\"howdoiuseit\">How do I use it?</h2><p>Originators can request same day ACH for transactions by setting the Effective Entry Date and Company Descriptive Date (check if required by your ODFI) fields to the same banking day as the day of submitting the the ACH file. These fields are on the batch header record of the <a href=\"https://engineering.gusto.com/how-ach-works-a-developer-perspective-part-4/\">ACH file</a>. <br/>\nUnfortunately, there are some practical limitations to be aware of before implementing same day ACH:</p><ol><li>International transactions (IATs) are excluded from same day ACH rules.  </li><li>ODFIs must set an earlier cut-off time to receive and process ACH files with same day entries from the Originator. In our case, the cut-off time set by our bank is 9am PT for Window 2. This in turn means that we would need an even earlier payroll run deadline to meet the final same day ACH window.  </li><li>There is a $25,000 per-transaction limit on same day ACH entries. NACHA <a href=\"https://www.nacha.org/system/files/resources/Same-Day-ACH-Guidance-%2425000%20Limit.pdf\">guidance</a> prohibits splitting larger transactions to work around this limit, but allows genuine use cases of multiple transactions between the same accounts on the same day.  </li><li>Banks are positioning same day ACH as an alternative to wires and pricing it accordingly. Depending on your relationship and contract with your bank, the per transaction cost can be more than 100 times that of regular ACH.  </li><li>Lastly but quite significantly - the timeline for leg 4 and leg 5 remains unchanged. This means RDFIs still have 24 hours to respond to the ACH request and it can still take 2 business days for the Originator to be notified of any <a href=\"https://engineering.gusto.com/how-ach-works-a-developer-perspective-part-2/\">returns</a>. The &ldquo;no news is good news&rdquo; policy remains intact and even with same day settlement, it makes sense to wait at least 2 business days before you can assume that your transaction was successful.</li></ol>"

We’ve improved how printed pages are rendered to ensure pages are reasonably sized instead of rendering them as mobile devices.

Don’t take it too seriously!</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><a href=\"https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/blog/\">Blog</a> has been rewritten from the ground up. Gone is the two column blue header layout. We’ve built a snarky magazine-style layout with featured posts and responsive navigation.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><a href=\"https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/dashboard/\">Dashboard</a> has been overhauled as well to feature a live ChartJS example, includes a refreshed sidebar with <a href=\"\">Feather icons</a>, and is semi-responsive.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><a href=\"https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/floating-labels/\">Floating labels</a> is brand new and builds on our sign-in example to provide a CSS-only implementation of the floating input label.

Our intent is to distill and document all the things we keep in our heads while writing code, building linters, and debugging. Much of this is focused on concepts and strategies for writing responsive CSS, using simple selectors, and limiting how much JavaScript one needs to write.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/extend/approach/\">Check out the new Approach page</a>, and be sure to open an issue or pull request with feedback and suggestions on what else to cover.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"known-issues\">Known issues</h2>\n\n<p>No release fixes every bug, and the same can be said for our v4 stable release. Here’s some of the things that we’re looking to tackle first in either a minor release (v4.1) or a patch release (v4.0.1) as time and scope allow.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><a href=\"https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/25110\">Input groups, validation, and rounded corners.</a> I rewrote this for Beta 3 and I thought nailed it, but I was mistaken. We have some rounded corner issues and the only way we can fix them with CSS without breaking backward compatibility is by limiting how extensible the component can be made. We may need a modifier class to avoid some gnarly CSS and satisfy all the key functionality. Check out the issue and cross-linked PR for more details.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Table variants, in particular <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">.table-active</code>, have a weird selector we’ve unintentionally left linger since prior releases. The bug results in <a href=\"https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/24529\">double application of an <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">rgba()</code> background color</a>—once for the <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">&lt;tr&gt;</code> and once for any <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">&lt;td&gt;</code>/<code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">&lt;th&gt;</code> elements within.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are a few more issues not yet confirmed or slated for our first patch release, but expect a handful of fixes coming your way before we hit the next minor release. We’ll likely also package up the default branch change for our repository in this next patch release. We didn’t have time to fit in testing a merge of a hugely divergent code base without nuking the entire Git history of v3. Again, more on that soon.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"next-releases\">Next releases</h2>\n\n<p>Speaking of releases, we’re excited about the momentum we have going for us. Our <a href=\"https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/projects\">GitHub project boards</a> are mostly up to date on upcoming releases, so feel free to jump in and take a look. Our next release will be v4.1 (pending any bugfix patches) and will focus on a slew of small new features, utilities, responsive font sizes, and more. From there we have a couple more minor releases that rally around another group of features.</p>\n\n<p>We aim to make RTL part of an upcoming minor release depending on overall scope. It’s taken us far too long to commit to this, but we’re on it. Our current plan is focused on implementing this into our build tools and components so you conditionally serve, for example, <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">bootstrap.min.css</code> or <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">bootstrap-rtl.min.css</code>. Weigh in on the open issue please with any feedback; when we’re ready, we’ll tee up a fresh pull request with help from the community.</p>\n\n<p>It’s worth reiterating that each minor release will bring a new hosted version of our documentation. Right now, we have <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/</code> and come v4.1’s release, we’ll have that plus <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/</code>. Prior releases will continue to be linked from our navigation as is already the case for v3.x and the last v4 alpha.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"themes-update\">Themes update</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://themes.getbootstrap.com\">Bootstrap Themes</a> are getting a major update this year! We’ve been absolutely thrilled with the response since we originally launched Bootstrap Themes and we’re finally ready to share our plans for what’s next.</p>\n\n<p>For the past few months, we’ve been working with some amazing theme creators  to bring their awesome work to the Official Bootstrap Themes store. We couldn’t be more excited to announce we’re expanding Bootstrap Themes to include ten brand new themes. We’re currently targeting a first quarter launch with themes all built on Bootstrap 4 (sorry, no v3 for these). Depending on final reviews, we might even get them to y’all in the coming weeks.</p>\n\n<p>So much of Bootstrap’s reach and usefulness comes directly from designers, developers, and creators all over the world building businesses with and on top of Bootstrap. We want to use our platform to give these creators an even larger audience and provide y’all with the best Bootstrap team-approved themes.</p>\n\n<p>Stay tuned for more information as we get ready to launch.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"thank-you\">Thank you</h2>\n\n<p>Finally, one last thank you to everyone who’s contributed to Bootstrap 4. It’s been a crazy journey and I’m personally relieved, thrilled, and anxious to call it stable. There have been roughly 6,000 commits to v4 since we first starting working on it back in 2015. We’ve gone every which direction and rewrote far too many things far too many times, but I’m so very happy and fortunate with where we landed.</p>\n\n<p>Cheers once again to everyone who’s contributed to and built with Bootstrap. It’s an honor to be building these kind of tools alongside and for all of you.</p>\n\n<p>&lt;3,<br />\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/mdo\">@mdo</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://github.com/twbs\">team</a></p>",

        "description": "<p>An old friend of mine recently posted a video blog that I found to be <em>brilliant</em>.</p><p>Mike (GeePaw) Hill presented <a href=\"http://geepawhill.org/five-underplayed-premises-of-tdd-2/\">Five Underplayed Premises of TDD</a> on a web page that contains an article and a video.  The video and the article appear to be identical in content; so you can read, or listen, or both.  However, there is much more information in the video, because Mike&rsquo;s passion is an effective seasoning to the solid content of his article.</p><p>The primary thrust of Mike&rsquo;s message is that TDD helps you to:</p><ul><li>Deliver Value Faster.</li><li>Exercise Good Judgement.</li><li>Improve Internal Quality.</li><li>Increase Efficiency.</li><li>Improve External Quality.</li></ul><p>Mike makes these points quickly, adeptly, and convincingly.  The video is a joy to watch.  The article is a joy to read.  They make me hope that the GeePaw series of video blogs will continue to produce such high quality content for a very long time.</p><h3 id=\"a-quibble\">A Quibble.</h3><p>But I have a quibble.  And it&rsquo;s kind of a big one &ndash; at least for me.  And so, for the rest of this article, I shall employ the <em>Writer&rsquo;s Workshop</em> convention of using the phrase &ldquo;The Author&rdquo;, instead of the author&rsquo;s name.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not a quibble with any of the author&rsquo;s major points.  Those points are perfectly solid.  It&rsquo;s a quibble with something the author said in an aside.</p><p>While discussing that TDD helps us deliver value faster, the author says:</p><blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;TDD is not about good citizenship. You are not immoral if you don&rsquo;t TDD. You&rsquo;re not not a good looker forwarder or a protector of the future. It&rsquo;s not about citizenship. TDD isn&rsquo;t even about raising the quality of your code. Now TDD very often does increase the quality of teams that aren&rsquo;t doing it to begin with, but that&rsquo;s actually neither here nor there, because TDD isn&rsquo;t about that. TDD is about more value faster.\n<br/><br/>\nThe other thing it&rsquo;s not about? It&rsquo;s not about art and it&rsquo;s not about craftsmanship. It&rsquo;s not about the excellence of our high standards. The reason we test drive is by test driving, we go faster. We put more value into the field faster than if we didn&rsquo;t do TDD. And that is the money premise. We&rsquo;re in this for the money.&rdquo;</em></p></blockquote><p>These two paragraphs are entirely inconsistent with the rest of the article in the following ways:</p><ul><li><p>The author asserts that TDD is not about quality; and yet his third and fifth points assert that TDD helps internal and external quality.  If you accept those points then clearly TDD <em>is</em> about raising the quality of your code, as well as the quality of your product.</p></li><li><p>The author asserts that TDD is not about art, or craftsmanship, or excellence of our high standards; and yet his five points stress <em>judgement</em>, and <em>quality</em>, and <em>efficiency</em> which are <em>the very essence</em> of craftsmanship, art, and high standards.</p></li><li><p>The author asserts that TDD is not about good citizenship or morality.  Herein lies the crux of my quibble; and so I must explain at some length.</p></li></ul><p>By &ldquo;citizenship&rdquo; I presume the author means <em>citizenship in the software community</em>.  By &ldquo;morality&rdquo; I presume the author means <em>professional ethics</em>.  In the following discussion we&rsquo;ll stick with the author&rsquo;s words and infer their meanings appropriately.</p><p>How can programmers be good moral citizens if they are not using the best means at their disposal to: deliver value faster, use good judgement, improve internal quality, increase efficiency, and improve external quality?  Is the author suggesting that a programmer who, out of negligence, goes slow, uses bad judgement, makes an internal mess, create gross inefficiencies, and delivers bad features is being a good moral citizen?  I think that&rsquo;s absurd.</p><p>Now, to be fair, it may be that the author&rsquo;s point is that TDD is not the <em>only</em> way to achieve these five goals; and that therefore TDD is not the only way to be a good moral citizen of the software community.  Whether that is so, or not, is irrelevant to the point.  The fact that TDD helps with those five goals <em>means</em> that TDD is about good moral citizenship.  It may not be the only path to that good moral citizenship; but it is a path.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s say this a different way.  Does the author believe that he would continue to be a good moral citizen of the software community if he abandoned TDD?  Now, since I know the author to be such a good moral citizen, the only possible answer to this question is: Yes!  Of course.  Because the only way the author would abandon TDD is if he found some better means to achieve those five goals.</p><p>And so we can deduce that the five goals are the issue; and not TDD.  Striving to achieve those five goals is what makes you a good moral citizen of the software community.  TDD is merely one of the paths that assist in that striving.</p><p>That&rsquo;s all well and good.  However, since TDD is a path towards the goals, it is not fair to say that TDD is not about the goals. TDD <em>is</em>, in fact, about being a good moral citizen of the software community.  TDD <em>is</em> about professional ethics.</p><p>Lastly, let me say that I eagerly await a better path to those goals.  So far, I haven&rsquo;t found one.</p>"

The company&rsquo;s tech stack includes the PHP Framework&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;among others. Hitherto now, I&rsquo;ve used (<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">and still use</em>) Laravel to build some awesome apps.</p><p name=\"13a0\" id=\"13a0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Laravel has a great logging system that is simple and elegant. Furthermore, there&rsquo;s a <a href=\"https://github.com/rap2hpoutre/laravel-log-viewer\" data-href=\"https://github.com/rap2hpoutre/laravel-log-viewer\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">library</a> for showing the logs in the browser. Being able to read the logs in the browser is good for application debugging and insight. Especially in a production environment.</p><p name=\"2248\" id=\"2248\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">So here I am in the world of CodeIgniter and couldn&rsquo;t find an equivalent library to read my logs for debugging and insight.</p><p name=\"5c45\" id=\"5c45\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">So I took up the challenge and created my first Open Source project of the year&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;<a href=\"https://github.com/SeunMatt/codeigniter-log-viewer\" data-href=\"https://github.com/SeunMatt/codeigniter-log-viewer\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">codeigniter-log-viewer</a>.</p><h3 name=\"5dfa\" id=\"5dfa\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Usage</h3><p name=\"4c1d\" id=\"4c1d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">First, let&rsquo;s add it to a dependency. We can do that by executing:</p><pre name=\"cebe\" id=\"cebe\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\">composer require seunmatt/codeigniter-log-viewer</pre><p name=\"cbc2\" id=\"cbc2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">Then, we can create a CodeIgniter application controller, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">LogViewerController.php</em>:</p><pre name=\"6ac3\" id=\"6ac3\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\">private $logViewer;</pre><pre name=\"eb44\" id=\"eb44\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\">public function __construct() {<br/>    $this->logViewer = new \\CILogViewer\\CILogViewer();<br/>    //...<br/>}</pre><pre name=\"6a38\" id=\"6a38\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\">public function index() {<br/>    echo $this->logViewer->showLogs();<br/>    return;<br/>}</pre><p name=\"41fd\" id=\"41fd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">What we did is to instantiate <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">$logViewer</em> in the constructor and then echo the result of <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">showLogs()</em> in the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">index()</em> function.</p><p name=\"3e25\" id=\"3e25\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">showLogs()</em> method of <a href=\"https://github.com/SeunMatt/codeigniter-log-viewer\" data-href=\"https://github.com/SeunMatt/codeigniter-log-viewer\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">codeigniter-log-viewer</a> will parse the content of the log files in <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">application/logs</em>&nbsp;<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">. </em>It will return it for display on the browser.</p><p name=\"e37a\" id=\"e37a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Finally, we can map any route of our choice to the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">index()</em> we created above. This can be done by adding an entry to the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">$route</em> array in <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">application/config/routes.php:</em></p><pre name=\"f5f9\" id=\"f5f9\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\">$route['logs'] = \"logViewerController/index\";</pre><p name=\"9360\" id=\"9360\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">Now we can visit <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">/logs</em> on the browser and see all the log files there. It&rsquo;s also possible to delete and download the log files.</p><p name=\"f81f\" id=\"f81f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Note</strong>: It is advisable to use a protected route in production environment to avoid general public access.</p><h3 name=\"b348\" id=\"b348\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">How it&nbsp;works</h3><p name=\"f377\" id=\"f377\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Internally, the library read the name of all the log files that are available in the default logs directory into an array and reverse it. If no file is specified in the URL query parameters, the latest log file is processed for display by default.</p><p name=\"95fb\" id=\"95fb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Processing of a log file for display involves reading its contents, using regex to determine the log level and the CSS class and icon of each entry.</p><p name=\"97d4\" id=\"97d4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Each entry is also checked to know if it&rsquo;s a new log line or a continuation of the previous line (<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">due to a newline character</em>).</p><p name=\"23e7\" id=\"23e7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Finally, the log entries are processed into HTML content that is then sent to the browser for display.</p><p name=\"099c\" id=\"099c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The complete source code is available on Github if you want to play around with it or/and adapt it for use in other frameworks.</p><h3 name=\"09b0\" id=\"09b0\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h3-strong\">Conclusion</strong></h3><p name=\"235a\" id=\"235a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Now it&rsquo;s easier and faster to debug CodeIgniter application&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;even in production. Spread the word around to friends and colleagues at work.</p><p name=\"258d\" id=\"258d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I want to hear about your experience (<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">and opinions</em>) of using the library in the comment section.

It&rsquo;s a project to help coders do one of four things: start coding, code more, blog more, or get a job.</p><p name=\"c7d2\" id=\"c7d2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">You pick a challenge, and over the course of 5, 7, or 9 weeks, you get a weekly mission with reading, research, and a homework assignment to help you reach your goal. It&rsquo;s based on powerful questions, guided research, and curated resources to help point you in the right direction. <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2DISkLU\" data-href=\"http://bit.ly/2DISkLU\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">You can learn more and sign up here (first mission is released Jan 22, so sign up by then)</a>.</p><p name=\"0fca\" id=\"0fca\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This challenge is based on a very simple premise: when you&rsquo;re learning to code, there is not one universal roadmap. It&rsquo;s frustrating, but it&rsquo;s the truth.</p><h4 name=\"fc91\" id=\"fc91\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">How I came up with&nbsp;#CNC2018</h4><figure name=\"2ea0\" id=\"2ea0\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--h4\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 467px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 66.60000000000001%;\"></div><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*RVYEyYPiu9ugXdGr2RhkeA.jpeg\" data-width=\"1400\" data-height=\"933\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*RVYEyYPiu9ugXdGr2RhkeA.jpeg\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*RVYEyYPiu9ugXdGr2RhkeA.jpeg\"/></div></figure><p name=\"d813\" id=\"d813\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">I sipped my cranberry juice as she raised her hand. She sat in the middle of the mostly empty room, and waited patiently to be noticed. They called on her, and she stood up to ask the infamous question, &ldquo;How do I start learning to code?&rdquo;</p><p name=\"35ec\" id=\"35ec\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">All the panelists turned to me, and my chest tightened. Of the four of us, I was the &ldquo;new coder expert,&rdquo; so I put my drink down and reluctantly pulled the mic to me.</p><p name=\"4c0e\" id=\"4c0e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I get this question often. I&rsquo;m usually excited to answer it. But today, I worried I would disappoint her.</p><p name=\"0d3d\" id=\"0d3d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It&rsquo;s a deceptively difficult question to answer. It assumes, first and foremost, that there <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">is</em> an answer; a single, uncontested, logical answer. It focuses so much on the &ldquo;start learning to code&rdquo; and less on the &ldquo;I&rdquo;, but the &ldquo;I&rdquo; is the most important part.</p><p name=\"ce1e\" id=\"ce1e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I used to give juicy, satisfying answers: Start with Ruby, it&rsquo;s the world&rsquo;s friendliest language! Try JavaScript, the language of the web! Use Codecademy to give you a little taste, it&rsquo;s free and you can start today!</p><p name=\"df9a\" id=\"df9a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">When I was feeling more resource-oriented, I went to my bag of websites and pulled a few out. Treehouse is great for videos and courses. FreeCodeCamp is a great community and learning resource for JavaScript. Check out Coursera for more computer science-y options. And you can&rsquo;t forget about good old fashioned YouTube! Search for a language or framework and pick a short video to get you started!</p><p name=\"95b8\" id=\"95b8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">They took furious notes as I spoke, proving that what I said was valuable and correct. But it wasn&rsquo;t.</p><p name=\"8979\" id=\"8979\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">There are many ways to start coding. There are many things to learn and resources to pick from. In the overwhelming plethora of options, we search for a roadmap. What is the single set of successive steps I can take to get to this particular destination?</p><p name=\"0ace\" id=\"0ace\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But in the hundreds of conversations I&rsquo;ve had with coding hopefuls, I&rsquo;ve learned that the &ldquo;I&rdquo; in &ldquo;How do I learn to start learning to code&rdquo; dictates any such roadmap, and that each roadmap is personal and unique.</p><p name=\"f4fd\" id=\"f4fd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Why am I learning to code? If you&rsquo;re learning specifically to get a job, your roadmap will be very different than if you&rsquo;re just learning for fun. Now, we have to think about what kind of job you&rsquo;re hoping for, how much money you want to make, where that job even is (are you willing to move, or should we focus on the local market?), and is there a deadline of when you need to get this new job? So many questions.</p><p name=\"7a01\" id=\"7a01\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Let&rsquo;s look at time and money. How much of each can I invest in this learning? If I don&rsquo;t have a lot of money (and how much do I consider to be &ldquo;a lot of money&rdquo;?), that eliminates a subsection of learn-to-code options. If I don&rsquo;t have a lot of time, what&rsquo;s something I can learn that&rsquo;s easy to pick up and doesn&rsquo;t require a huge a time commitment to get started? What am I sacrificing for that ease? So many more questions.</p><p name=\"fb23\" id=\"fb23\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Next, let&rsquo;s inspect community. Do I have people in my life who can serve as tutors, teachers, possibly mentors? Do I live in a place where I can get in-person support, or will that support primarily be online? Does it matter? If I&rsquo;m doing this all by myself, finding an in-person course might make the journey easier. If I have developers in my life, I can reach out to them to course correct and guide me, making my journey a bit more efficient. Questions galore.</p><p name=\"58f1\" id=\"58f1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">All of these questions are so important, and they&rsquo;re all about you. So I held the mic and took a big breath and told this woman exactly that. It would&rsquo;ve been nice to give her a roadmap, a three-step magic trick to get to where she wanted to go. But there just isn&rsquo;t one.</p><p name=\"3662\" id=\"3662\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I paused when I finished, looked at her then around the room to see how this answer would be received. I braced myself for disappointment. The other panelists nodded, the room smiled, the woman seemed genuinely appreciative. Surprised, but reflective. I sighed with relief and took a sip of my juice.</p><p name=\"af8b\" id=\"af8b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">That&rsquo;s been my go-to answer ever since, and I can feel how much more helpful it is. The problem is that getting the most value from that answer usually involves a conversation, a back and forth to explore and dissect. I&rsquo;ve been thinking of ways to scale this. How do you scale the answer to such a personal question, when there are so many things to consider, and no single, right answer? You create the <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2DISkLU\" data-href=\"http://bit.ly/2DISkLU\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CodeNewbie Challenge</a>.</p><p name=\"e3b5\" id=\"e3b5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Over time, #CNC2018 helps you create and iterate on your personal roadmap, your own curriculum, based on your needs and lifestyle. And like most adventures, it&rsquo;s much easier to do with friends. So we&rsquo;ve created a closed Facebook group so can you share your wins, your lessons, and your story with others.</p><p name=\"b3ac\" id=\"b3ac\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">I&rsquo;m so excited to finally launch it. It&rsquo;s a brand new year, the perfect time to take on a new challenge. So join <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2DISkLU\" data-href=\"http://bit.ly/2DISkLU\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#CNC2018</a> and sign up by Jan 22.

        "title": "The Importance of Offsite Backups",
        "description": "<h3 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h3><p>Data has become some of the most valuable and irreplaceable assets for both individuals and businesses alike. Whether it consists of vacation photos, last year&rsquo;s sales reports, or top-secret corporate strategy plans, the last thing you want is for your data to be lost or to fall into the wrong hands. </p><p>Backing up important files using an auxiliary storage device has become an everyday data protection practice, but this is not by itself a sure-fire solution. After all, backup media have the same risk of being damaged or stolen if they&rsquo;re stored in the same place as the data&rsquo;s source. In order to add an extra layer of protection to their valuable information, many people and companies choose to store their backups at an offsite venue to improve their odds against data loss.</p><p>In this article, we&rsquo;ll go over some of the history and technology behind offsite data backups, as well as some practical matters to consider when remotely backing up your own data.</p><h2 id=\"a-bit-about-auxiliary-storage\">A Bit About Auxiliary Storage</h2><p>The history of auxiliary storage can be traced to the use of punched paper cards as a means of recording and storing information. Punch cards were invented in France in the early 18th century as a way to control patterns in a textile loom, and through the 1800s they were adapted into other uses ranging from calculating numbers to controlling player pianos. However, these initial use cases were solely used to instruct machinery and otherwise did not store data. </p><p>This changed in 1890 as a result of the United States census. The country&rsquo;s rapidly growing population and new requirements for more detailed population information meant that the Census Bureau needed to drastically improve its efficiency so as to process the census data in a timely fashion. This need led Herman Hollerith, then an employee of the Census Bureau, to develop the Hollerith Electric Tabulating System which used punched cards to tabulate and store population data.</p><p>Hollerith&rsquo;s punch card machines soon became the industry standard for data storage. His company would eventually be merged into the conglomerate that would form International Business Machines, Inc. &mdash; better known today as IBM &mdash; which would continue to produce punch cards into the 1970s. But as businesses and governments&rsquo; data storage needs grew, punched paper cards became severely limiting in terms of how much data they could hold and how quickly they could be read by machines. </p><p>Technology marched forward, though, and each successive generation of auxiliary storage media &mdash; from magnetic tape, to hard drives, floppy disks, and optical disks &mdash; brought an ever-increasing areal density (the quantity of information bits that can be stored in a given unit of physical space on computer storage media) while simultaneously reducing the cost-per-megabyte of storable data. They also enabled faster read and write speeds, making it easier for people and organizations to store and retrieve their data.</p><h2 id=\"moving-data-offsite\">Moving Data Offsite</h2><p>The need to have backup copies of crucial data has been clear for as long as people have been keeping important records. Because originals could be lost or damaged in an accident, and malicious actors were likely to target valuable information for theft, the urgency to not just backup data but also keep that data secure was only underscored. This led many people and organizations over the years to protect their data at offsite storage facilities. However, storing backup data at an outside location brought a number of logistical challenges.</p><p>Before the ubiquity of software that can quickly transfer files over the internet, an organization&rsquo;s only option for offsite storage involved physically moving auxiliary storage devices. Reels of magnetic tape or stacks of hard drives would need to be picked up from the central location and delivered to the storage vault by car, which could turn out to be extremely costly for institutions producing a great deal of data backups. </p><p>Because storage media deteriorates over time, it was important for companies building storage facilities to be aware of the physical limitations of data stores. Magnetic tape has an estimated shelf life of about 10 years, floppy disks have around 10 to 20, and older types of optical media can only be expected to last about about 5 to 10. This degradation meant that older storage devices would need to be regularly cycled out and replaced with new ones to prevent data loss. Regardless of what storage format is used, data backups have always been vulnerable to physical damage, particularly from fire, smoke, water, excessive heat, natural disaster, and even dust. Therefore, privately managed storage facilities would also have had to be built with controls against these environmental factors in place.</p><p>Finally, there was the ever-present issue of keeping data secure. Computer data encryption didn&rsquo;t see broad implementation until the late 1970s, and even then it was primarily the tool of only the largest corporations and governments. This meant that, for the most part, your data&rsquo;s security was only as strong as the lock on your door.</p><p>Altogether, this put a sizable burden of responsibility on the part of companies and institutions who would store their backups at their own offsite location. It wasn&rsquo;t until the late 1980s that public cloud remote backup services began to appear. This was largely due to the fact that, until that time, modem speeds were too slow for internet data transfer to be practical. However, almost all of the remote backup services at this time were only focused on enterprise-level customers, leaving consumers and small businesses with few options for where to store offsite data backups. </p><h2 id=\"backup-alternatives-in-the-cloud\">Backup Alternatives in the Cloud</h2><p>With the rise of cloud computing in the mid-2000&rsquo;s, along with an ample spike in the amount of data created by organizations and individuals, cloud-based data storage has become a convenient and affordable solution. Services like Crashplan or Backblaze are online backup services focused on business clients. Likewise, the rise of file hosting services like Dropbox has brought consumers the ability to backup their data remotely as well. </p><p>Although public cloud storage solutions like these do resolve many of the issues generated by previous methods of offsite data backups, there are still several risks associated with them. For example, remote data centers are at just as much risk of natural disasters as anywhere else. Of course, any reputable cloud storage provider is going to take steps to mitigate these particular risks with fire- and flood-resistant building materials and contingency plans for power outages. Also, like any other kind of company, a remote backup service could be sold, close down, or change its services, potentially leaving clients in a difficult place as they seek out alternatives.</p><p>Despite this, remote backup solutions still offer many desirable features. For example, they take care of all the logistics that go into managing a data vault, and their user-friendly interfaces lower the cost of training employees on how to use the service. Because these companies specialize in data backups and storage, they are usually better equipped to adapt to new technologies and innovative solutions than a company managing its own offsite data storage. Also, most cloud storage companies have redundancy built into their infrastructure to prevent outages or data loss, helping to ensure high availability of their customers&rsquo; data (although it never hurts to duplicate backups yourself, just in case).</p><p>All of this means that remote backup services are typically cheaper and easier than a completely self-managed offsite solution, but it&rsquo;s important to research each one&rsquo;s options and features before signing up for any remote backup service. </p><h2 id=\"object-storage-as-a-backups-solution\">Object Storage as a Backups Solution</h2><p>In recent years, object storage solutions such as <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/products/object-storage/\">DigitalOcean Spaces</a> have become popular alternatives to traditional offsite backup services. While public cloud backup services are popular for their simplicity and easy implementation, object storage services offer a level of flexibility that could be better suited for some companies&rsquo; storage needs.</p><p>Thanks to the design of the object storage model, object storage services can allow users to store very large amounts of data at a lower cost when compared to remote backup or file-sharing services. This makes them highly scalable, which is appealing to companies that are positioning themselves for future growth. Also, because of features like replication and erasure coding, object storage makes it easy to duplicate data, bringing another layer of protection against data loss and ensuring high availability.</p><p>Object storage isn&rsquo;t always a perfect solution, especially if a user needs to make frequent changes to their data and perform lots of random data access. However, if you&rsquo;re in need of relatively static archival storage, object storage services are a convenient, elegant, and highly affordable solution for securely storing your company&rsquo;s key information.</p><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>By now, it&rsquo;s fairly common knowledge that performing regular backups is an important data security practice, but even small businesses and consumers are beginning to realize the value of storing their backups at an offsite location. After all, it only takes one stroke of bad luck and everything from family photos to corporate financials could be gone in an instant.</p><p>It has been a long road from the days of shipping cartons of punch cards to an off-site archive to the development of today&rsquo;s cloud storage solutions. However, thanks to advances in technology and new paradigms like cloud-based backups and object storage services, both businesses and individuals now have the ability to securely backup their data at a remote location almost instantly.</p><p>For more information on storage and backups solutions, the following tutorials may be of interest:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-digitalocean-spaces\">Introduction to DigitalOcean Spaces</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-choose-an-effective-backup-strategy-for-your-vps\">How To Choose an Effective Backup Strategy for your VPS</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/object-storage-vs-block-storage-services\">Object Storage vs. Block Storage Services</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-back-up-a-synology-nas-to-digitalocean-spaces\">How To Back Up a Synology NAS to DigitalOcean Spaces</a></li></ul>"

It was gut-wrenching. I&rsquo;ve fired people before&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;but it doesn&rsquo;t matter how many times you do it, it always feels downright terrible.</p><p name=\"49bc\" id=\"49bc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">To prepare for the difficult conversation, I asked a few mentors for advice. I also posed the question to <a href=\"https://thewatercooler.io\" data-href=\"https://thewatercooler.io\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Watercooler</a>, our community of leaders from all over the world, to learn how others handle letting someone go.</p><p name=\"fa88\" id=\"fa88\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">From almost 500 CEOs, managers, and executives, I compiled six recommendations on how to handle firing someone with dignity, grace and respect that I thought I&rsquo;d share with you here:</p><h4 name=\"6a45\" id=\"6a45\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Privacy, please.</h4><p name=\"1d8e\" id=\"1d8e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Choose a conference room that&rsquo;s away from the team, ideally that&rsquo;s close to the exits. Or, if you&rsquo;re a remote team, make sure you&rsquo;re in a place that&rsquo;s private when you make your Skype or Google Hangout call. Make sure your phone is turned off and door is closed so you&rsquo;re not interrupted. And never <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">ever</em> do it in a public place, like a coffee shop.</p><h4 name=\"ca35\" id=\"ca35\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">The &ldquo;optimal&rdquo; time doesn&rsquo;t&nbsp;exist.</h4><p name=\"d650\" id=\"d650\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Everyone has different opinions about whether you should let someone go on Friday end-of-day, or earlier in the week&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;but really, it&rsquo;s moot. Once the decision has been made, it&rsquo;s best to let the person go as fast as possible. There never is an &ldquo;optimal&rdquo; time to fire someone. Don&rsquo;t let time or day or day of week become an excuse to delay. The longer you wait, the more your interactions with that person become disingenuous and uncomfortable in the days and hours leading up to you telling them they&rsquo;re being let go.</p><h4 name=\"20f3\" id=\"20f3\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Cut to the&nbsp;chase.</h4><p name=\"7ac0\" id=\"7ac0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Don&rsquo;t dawdle or make small talk. Your opening sentence should be delivered in 5 seconds or less. For example, one Watercooler member suggested you say, &ldquo;Claire, I&rsquo;m letting you go effective immediately.&rdquo; Be clear, succinct, and direct. Nothing you can say will soften the blow so don&rsquo;t try to sugar coat your message or ask about how a project is going, etc.</p><h4 name=\"679e\" id=\"679e\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">It&rsquo;s a decision, not a conversation.</h4><p name=\"4d27\" id=\"4d27\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Don&rsquo;t get drawn into an extensive conversation or argument&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;it&rsquo;s a decision that&rsquo;s been made, not something that&rsquo;s up for debate. Make that clear. One Watercooler member suggested that after stating that you&rsquo;re letting this person go, your second sentence should articulate terms (severance, impact to equity, etc), and your third sentence should indicate this is non-negotiable. Listen to their reaction, answer questions as you see fit, but try not to get pulled into defending your decision for hours on end.</p><h4 name=\"cf01\" id=\"cf01\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">This sucks for you, but sucks way worse for&nbsp;them.</h4><p name=\"fb1b\" id=\"fb1b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Another <a href=\"https://thewatercooler.io\" data-href=\"https://thewatercooler.io\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Watercooler</a> member cautioned that you may be tempted to offer comfort by saying something like, &ldquo;This is a difficult decision&rdquo; or &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t want to do this.&rdquo; But the last thing you want to do is indulge and pontificate on how you&rsquo;re personally feeling. To be frank, the other person doesn&rsquo;t care how difficult the decision was for you&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;you made it, regardless. And, if you really didn&rsquo;t want to do it, you wouldn&rsquo;t have. Of course it sucks for you, but that&rsquo;s not for you to impose on the person you&rsquo;re firing. Find someone else to confide your pain in, and keep in mind that the decision you&rsquo;re making is on behalf of the team, the company, and their best interest.</p><h4 name=\"60ef\" id=\"60ef\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Communicate the decision to your team with&nbsp;grace.</h4><p name=\"303a\" id=\"303a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Ask how the person being let go prefers to break the news to the team. Their preference might be to send a farewell note themselves, or personally tell the team members they are closest with. Other times, they&rsquo;ll ask you to simply relay the news for them. If it&rsquo;s the latter, share the news with respect and mindfulness. Even if the person was fired for performance reasons that were 100% their own fault, thoughtfully consider what is appropriate to disclose. Imagine if the person fired were to overhear you sharing the news with the team: Would they feel it was fair? Use this as a benchmark for how to communicate the decision to your team.</p><p name=\"70d7\" id=\"70d7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">No matter how you do it, letting someone go is one of the hardest things to do as a leader. There truly is no &ldquo;best way&rdquo;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;but hopefully these tips will be helpful should you face this situation in the future.</p><p name=\"a990\" id=\"a990\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">I know it&rsquo;s helped me.</p></div></div></section><section name=\"1e37\" class=\"section section--body\"><div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"/></div><div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p name=\"7f0b\" id=\"7f0b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--leading\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">What&rsquo;s this &ldquo;</em><a href=\"https://thewatercooler.io\" data-href=\"https://thewatercooler.io\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Watercooler</em></a><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">&rdquo; thing I keep mentioning?

Any type, be it primitive or an object, is a valid subject for type coercion. To recall, primitives are: number, string, boolean, null, undefined + Symbol (added in ES6).</p><p name=\"5df6\" id=\"5df6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">As an example of type coercion in practice, look at the <a href=\"https://dorey.github.io/JavaScript-Equality-Table/\" data-href=\"https://dorey.github.io/JavaScript-Equality-Table/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">JavaScript Comparison Table</a>, which shows how the loose equality <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">==</code> operator behaves for different <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">a</code> and <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">b</code> types. This matrix looks scary due to implicit type coercion that <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">==</code> operator does, and it&rsquo;s hardly possible to remember all those combinations. And you don&rsquo;t have to do that&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;just learn the underlying type coercion principles.</p><p name=\"b30c\" id=\"b30c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This article goes in-depth on how type coercion works in JavaScript, and will arm you with the essential knowledge, so you can feel confident explaining what following expressions calculate to. By the end of the article I&rsquo;ll show answers and explain them.</p><pre name=\"cc4b\" id=\"cc4b\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\">true + false<br/>12 / \"6\"<br/>\"number\" + 15 + 3<br/>15 + 3 + \"number\"<br/>[1] > null<br/>\"foo\" + + \"bar\"<br/>'true' == true<br/>false == 'false'<br/>null == ''<br/>!!\"false\" == !!\"true\"<br/>[&lsquo;x&rsquo;] == &lsquo;x&rsquo;<br/>[] + null + 1<br/>[1,2,3] == [1,2,3]<br/>{}+[]+{}+[1]<br/>!+[]+[]+![]<br/>new Date(0) - 0<br/>new Date(0) + 0</pre><p name=\"840f\" id=\"840f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">Yes, this list is full of pretty silly things you can do as a developer. In 90% of use cases it&rsquo;s better to avoid implicit type coercion. Consider this list as a learning exercise to test your knowledge on how type coercion works. If you&rsquo;re bored, you can find more examples on <a href=\"https://wtfjs.com/\" data-href=\"https://wtfjs.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">wtfjs.com</a>.</p><p name=\"024a\" id=\"024a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">By the way, sometimes you might face such questions on the interview for a JavaScript developer position. So, keep reading &#128516;</p><h3 name=\"d79a\" id=\"d79a\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Implicit vs. explicit&nbsp;coercion</h3><p name=\"7695\" id=\"7695\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Type coercion can be explicit and implicit.</p><p name=\"260e\" id=\"260e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">When a developer expresses the intention to convert between types by writing the appropriate code, like <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">Number(value)</code>, it&rsquo;s called <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">explicit type coercion</strong> (or type casting).</p><p name=\"26d8\" id=\"26d8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Since JavaScript is a weakly-typed language, values can also be converted between different types automatically, and it is called <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">implicit type coercion</strong>. It usually happens when you apply operators to values of different types, like<br/><code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">1 == null</code>, <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">2/&rsquo;5'</code>, <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">null + new Date()</code>, or it can be triggered by the surrounding context, like with <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">if (value) {&hellip;}</code>, where <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">value</code> is coerced to boolean.</p><p name=\"324e\" id=\"324e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">One operator that does not trigger implicit type coercion is <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">===</code>, which is called the strict equality operator. The loose equality operator <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">==</code> on the other hand does both comparison and type coercion if needed.</p><p name=\"a399\" id=\"a399\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Implicit type coercion is a double edge sword: it&rsquo;s a great source of frustration and defects, but also a useful mechanism that allows us to write less code without losing the readability.</p><h3 name=\"be78\" id=\"be78\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Three types of conversion</h3><p name=\"4e59\" id=\"4e59\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">The first rule to know is there are only three types of conversion in JavaScript:</p><ul class=\"postList\"><li name=\"1ef8\" id=\"1ef8\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">to string</li><li name=\"b0bd\" id=\"b0bd\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">to boolean</li><li name=\"d38b\" id=\"d38b\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">to number</li></ul><p name=\"8f93\" id=\"8f93\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">Secondly, conversion logic for primitives and objects works differently, but both primitives and objects can only be converted in those three ways.</p><p name=\"a1bd\" id=\"a1bd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Let&rsquo;s start with primitives first.</p><h3 name=\"a92e\" id=\"a92e\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">String conversion</h3><p name=\"96c8\" id=\"96c8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">To explicitly convert values to a string apply the <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">String()</code> function.

It is admittedly <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">gorgeous</em>.</p><p name=\"0da9\" id=\"0da9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">As it turns out, however, the iPhone X&rsquo;s most groundbreaking feature is not even discernible at first glance, even though it literally stares you in the face.</p><h3 name=\"b9af\" id=\"b9af\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Meet the TrueDepth IR&nbsp;Camera</h3><p name=\"338d\" id=\"338d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Apple has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/30/pressure-tim-cook-innovation-apple\" data-href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/30/pressure-tim-cook-innovation-apple\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">dogged by perceptions</a> that the company&rsquo;s product roadmap has grown conservative and predictable in the six years following Steve Jobs&rsquo; passing. The new TrueDepth IR camera, as Apple calls the iPhone X&rsquo;s secondary front-facing camera, could well help Apple dispel those rumors of complacency.</p><p name=\"c428\" id=\"c428\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">New to the iPhone X and housed in the black notch at the top of the display, the technology includes a number of high tech components such as a &ldquo;flood illuminator,&rdquo; infrared (IR) camera, and an infrared emitter. The latter emits 30,000 infrared dots in a known pattern when a face is detected, enabling the iPhone X to generate a 3D map of a user&rsquo;s face. Notably, the TrueDepth IR camera can do this fast enough to support the creation of 3D motion data as well.</p><figure name=\"41a1\" id=\"41a1\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 500px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 71.39999999999999%;\"></div><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*7zsbw9jLHiMRrboxNIsMtQ.png\" data-width=\"1024\" data-height=\"731\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*7zsbw9jLHiMRrboxNIsMtQ.png\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*7zsbw9jLHiMRrboxNIsMtQ.png\"/></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">TrueDepth IR can create a 3D map of your face using an infrared camera and emitter.

(Photo credit:&nbsp;Apple)</figcaption></figure><h3 name=\"fe55\" id=\"fe55\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--figure\">&ldquo;What&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;that&rsquo;s&nbsp;it?&rdquo;</h3><p name=\"c71a\" id=\"c71a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Admittedly, the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">current </em>use cases for this technology are limited.</p><p name=\"03ca\" id=\"03ca\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Animoji are just emoji with a fun twist, and unlocking phones hasn&rsquo;t exactly been a pain point for modern smartphone users, with the prevalence of fingerprint sensors on many phones and pattern drawing as an adequate secondary option.</p><p name=\"cebb\" id=\"cebb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">What&rsquo;s incredibly intriguing is that the TrueDepth IR camera technology can and will have much stronger applications in the very near future. As with the iPhone&rsquo;s previous Touch ID (fingerprint sensor), an iOS SDK makes it easy for app developers to use Face ID and the TrueDepth IR camera for a myriad of other more compelling use cases. In fact, Face ID uses the exact same API as Touch ID, making implementation into mobile apps incredibly simple.</p><p name=\"c5ef\" id=\"c5ef\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Here are some of the areas where the TrueDepth IR camera could spawn useful or interesting mobile applications:</p><h3 name=\"e793\" id=\"e793\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Financial Services and Internet&nbsp;Banking</h3><p name=\"d285\" id=\"d285\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">For more than a decade, the gold standard in Internet banking authentication has been two-factor authentication. One of the most common forms of two-factor authentication has involved sending a verification code sent to your phone or email address, which must then be manually entered along with your password to access your account.</p><p name=\"3757\" id=\"3757\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In the past few years, mobile banking apps have been quick to add support for fingerprint-based authentication. This has made it easier than ever to access your bank accounts online using your mobile phone. For the banks, this means customers have easier access to their services, resulting in increased revenues.</p><p name=\"dbf8\" id=\"dbf8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Why, given the already enhanced convenience of fingerprint-based authentication, would banks care about implementing face recognition into their mobile apps? To understand why, let&rsquo;s consider false positive rates&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;the rate at which any given authentication protocol provides a false authentication. Apple claims that Touch ID, its fingerprint based authentication, has a false positive rate of 1 in 50,000. Compare that to the chance of guessing a four-digit PIN, 1 in 10,000.</p><p name=\"f558\" id=\"f558\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Now, let&rsquo;s look at the iPhone X&rsquo;s new Face ID feature. Apple claims Face ID has a false positive rate of approximately 1 in 1,000,000. <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">If true, this represents a 20-fold improvement in accuracy compared to fingerprint based authentication and 100-fold improvement over a four-digit PIN.</em></p><p name=\"2968\" id=\"2968\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">That&rsquo;s sure to get the attention of the banks offering Internet banking, as well as of the consumers who also benefit from enhanced fraud protection. In fact, many banks have already implemented Face ID support into their iOS apps. Chase, for example, <a href=\"https://media.chase.com/content/pr/chase-mobile-app-introduces-face-id\" data-href=\"https://media.chase.com/content/pr/chase-mobile-app-introduces-face-id\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">added Face ID support within two weeks of the iPhone X&rsquo;s launch</a>.</p><h3 name=\"07ea\" id=\"07ea\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Entertainment and&nbsp;Fun</h3><p name=\"d3d7\" id=\"d3d7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">iOS 11 introduced <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/arkit/\" data-href=\"https://developer.apple.com/arkit/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ARKit</a>, a new framework that allows developers to easily create unparalleled augmented reality experiences for iPhone and iPad. Combined with the iPhone X&rsquo;s TrueDepth IR camera, ARKit opens up a revolutionary capability for robust face tracking across multiple app categories.</p><p name=\"ccc2\" id=\"ccc2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Imagine:</p><ul class=\"postList\"><li name=\"4fc7\" id=\"4fc7\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">Entering the character creation screen for Assassin&rsquo;s Creed: Identity and being able to not only choose your assassin&rsquo;s class but also their visual identity, using your own face in place of the default character model&rsquo;s</li><li name=\"9bee\" id=\"9bee\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Having a more accurate view of a prospective match&rsquo;s face before you choose to swipe left or swipe right on Tinder, Bumble, or POF</li><li name=\"cd33\" id=\"cd33\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Being able to skip a trip to Sephora or ULTA and experiment with new makeup without shelling out for everything up front</li></ul><p name=\"95a9\" id=\"95a9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">A few years ago, virtual reality (VR) technology was in the same place that the technology behind TrueDepth IR is now: a promising technology needing stronger applications in video games and entertainment.</p><p name=\"40f6\" id=\"40f6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Oculus, a virtual reality company, was founded in 2012 and ran a successful Kickstarter campaign that year, raising $2.5 million. Just two years later in 2014, Oculus was acquired by Facebook for <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">$2 billion</em>, or nearly one thousand times the initial financing round. Could companies that invest in entertainment applications using TrueDepth IR technology find a similar trajectory?</p><p name=\"54bd\" id=\"54bd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">There are already precedents in the space, too. Two years ago&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;when face tracking was still based on two-dimensional images&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;<a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-facebook-masquerade-20160309-snap-story.html\" data-href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-facebook-masquerade-20160309-snap-story.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook purchased (for an undisclosed amount) Masquerade</a>, a startup whose MSQRD app lets users create self-altered images and video using face tracking technology.</p><h3 name=\"38be\" id=\"38be\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Medical and&nbsp;Fitness</h3><p name=\"638d\" id=\"638d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Imagine being able to have a medical examination at any hour of the day, on-demand, from the convenience of your bed, sofa, or office chair. With the help of the iPhone X&rsquo;s TrueDepth IR camera, this could become a reality.</p><p name=\"d094\" id=\"d094\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">TrueDepth IR technology has the potential to be used for medical imaging, because it can create detailed 3D maps of your face, including the surface of your skin. Notably, it can also capture 3D movement, including subtle changes in facial expression.</p><p name=\"603c\" id=\"603c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Consider the following potential medical use cases:</p><ul class=\"postList\"><li name=\"750c\" id=\"750c\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">Have a dermatologist examine an abnormal skin growth, with the ability to rotate the image for a better look at the structure of a potential tumor, for example.</li><li name=\"3391\" id=\"3391\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Have your phone automatically alert you when it notices facial cues or subtle movements that could be associated with the onset of a stroke, seizure, or heart attack.</li><li name=\"766b\" id=\"766b\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">For recovering stroke patients, you might have an app that tracks any muscular degeneration over time and provides your doctors with this detailed 3D image data on demand.</li></ul><p name=\"0973\" id=\"0973\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">While these use cases would certainly not replace the need to have in-person examinations, regular screening via phone camera could play a supporting role in enabling early detection or regular monitoring of known medical conditions.</p><p name=\"22ec\" id=\"22ec\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Consider also that Apple has published a software development kit (SDK) called Apple Healthkit, which allows app developers API access to rich health and fitness information across a variety of sources: fitness wearables, health devices, and software applications. New or updated mobile apps might combine health vitals from Apple Healthkit with 3D facial image data to offer a more complete assessment of users&rsquo; health or fitness.</p><figure name=\"7af0\" id=\"7af0\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 500px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 71.39999999999999%;\"></div><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*5Zwa5LjoVU4usrBcThImvg.png\" data-width=\"1024\" data-height=\"731\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*5Zwa5LjoVU4usrBcThImvg.png\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*5Zwa5LjoVU4usrBcThImvg.png\"/></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Apple Healthkit integrations will allow TrueDepth IR to be used for health and fitness assessments.

Graphcool has a serverless function concept that allows you to extend the functionalities of your server. This feature can be used to achieve a lot of 3rd party integrations including authentication.</p><p>Some functions for such integrations have been pre-packaged for you so you don&rsquo;t have to create them from scratch. You only need to install the template, uncomment some configuration and types, then update or tweak the code as you wish.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s add the Auth0 template. Make sure you are in the <code>server</code> folder and run the following:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">graphcool-framework add-template graphcool/templates/auth/auth0</code></pre><p>This will create an <code>auth0</code> folder in <code>server/src</code>. This folder contains both the function logic, types and the mutation definition that triggers this function.</p><p><strong>Create and Add Credentials</strong></p><p>We need to create an Auth0 API and then add the API&rsquo;s configuration to our server. Create <a href=\"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/scotch_io/~https://auth0.auth0.com/login\">an account</a> first, then create a new API from you API dasboard. You can name the API what ever you like. Provide an identifier that is unique to all your existing APIs (URLs are mostly recommended):</p><p><img data-src=\"https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_314FE62DA58A8C6BA53A9259B1A05DBDCF00D90AC3786DDEAAD8086A93E6258D_1516078590207_Screen+Shot+2018-01-15+at+2.23.40+PM.png\" alt=\"\"/><img/></p><p><strong>Uncomment Config</strong>\r\nUncomment the template configuration in <code>server/src/graphcool.yml</code> and update it to look like this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-yml\">    authenticate:\r\n        handler:\r\n          code:\r\n            src: ./src/auth0/auth0Authentication.js\r\n            environment:\r\n              AUTH0_DOMAIN: [YOUR AUTH0 DOMAIN]\r\n              AUTH0_API_IDENTIFIER: [YOUR AUTH0 IDENTIFIER]\r\n        type: resolver\r\n        schema: ./src/auth0/auth0Authentication.graphql</code></pre><p><code>AUTH0_DOMAIN</code> and <code>AUTH0_API_IDENTIFIER</code> will be exposed on <code>process.env</code> in your function as environmental variables.</p><p><strong>Uncomment Model</strong>\r\nThe add template command also generates a type in <code>server/src/types.graphql</code>. It&rsquo;s commented by default. You need to uncomment:</p><pre><code class=\"language-graphql\">    type User @model {\r\n      # Required system field:\r\n      id: ID! @isUnique # read-only (managed by Graphcool)\r\n      # Optional system fields (remove if not needed):\r\n      createdAt: DateTime! # read-only (managed by Graphcool)\r\n      updatedAt: DateTime! # read-only (managed by Graphcool)\r\n      email: String\r\n      auth0UserId: String @isUnique\r\n    }</code></pre><p>You need to remove the <code>User</code> type that was generated when the server was created so that this auth <code>User</code> type can replace it.</p><p><strong>Update Code</strong>\r\nWe need to make some tweaks to the authentication logic.

Let&rsquo;s see how we can get tokens from Auth0.</p><p><strong>Create client</strong>\r\nJust like creating an API, we also need to create a client for the project. The client is used to trigger authentication from the browser. </p><p><strong>Create a Client</strong>\r\nOn your Auth0 dashboard navigation, click clients and create a new client:</p><p><img data-src=\"https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_314FE62DA58A8C6BA53A9259B1A05DBDCF00D90AC3786DDEAAD8086A93E6258D_1516083155222_Screen+Shot+2018-01-15+at+8.46.37+PM.png\" alt=\"\"/><img/></p><p>The application type should be set to Single Page Web Applications which is what a routed React app is.</p><p><strong>Configure callback url</strong>\r\nWhen auth is initiated, it redirects to your Auth0 domain to verify the user. When the user is verified, it needs to redirect the user back to your app. The callback URL is where it comes back to after redirecting. Go to the settings tab of the client you just created and set the callback URL:</p><p><img data-src=\"https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_314FE62DA58A8C6BA53A9259B1A05DBDCF00D90AC3786DDEAAD8086A93E6258D_1516083431288_Screen+Shot+2018-01-16+at+4.02.37+AM.png\" alt=\"\"/><img/></p><p><strong>Auth Service</strong>\r\nWe are done with setting up a client configuration on the Auth0 dashboard. Next thing we want to do is create a service in our React app that exposes few methods. These methods will handle utility tasks like triggering authentication, handling response from Auth0, logging out, etc.</p><p>First install the Auth0 JS library:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">yarn add auth0-js</code></pre><p>Then create a <code>services</code> folder in <code>src</code>. Add a <code>auth.js</code> in the new folder with the following content:</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">    import auth0 from 'auth0-js';\r\n    export default class Auth {\r\n      auth0 = new auth0.WebAuth({\r\n        domain: '[Auth0 Domain]',\r\n        clientID: '[Auth0 Client ID]',\r\n        redirectUri: 'http://localhost:3000/callback',\r\n        audience: '[Auth0 Client Audience]',\r\n        responseType: 'token id_token',\r\n        scope: 'openid profile email'\r\n      });\r\n      handleAuthentication(cb) {\r\n        this.auth0.parseHash({hash: window.location.hash}, (err, authResult) => {\r\n          if (authResult &amp;&amp; authResult.accessToken &amp;&amp; authResult.idToken) {\r\n            this.auth0.client.userInfo(authResult.accessToken, (err, profile) => {\r\n              this.storeAuth0Cred(authResult, profile);\r\n              cb(false, {...authResult, ...profile})\r\n            });\r\n          } else if (err) {\r\n            console.log(err);\r\n            cb(true, err)\r\n          }\r\n        });\r\n      }\r\n      storeAuth0Cred(authResult, profile) {\r\n        // Set the time that the access token will expire at\r\n        let expiresAt = JSON.stringify(\r\n          authResult.expiresIn * 1000 + new Date().getTime()\r\n        );\r\n        localStorage.setItem('scotch_auth_access_token', authResult.accessToken);\r\n        localStorage.setItem('scotch_auth_id_token', authResult.idToken);\r\n        localStorage.setItem('scotch_auth_expires_at', expiresAt);\r\n        localStorage.setItem('scotch_auth_profile', JSON.stringify(profile));\r\n      }\r\n      storeGraphCoolCred(authResult) {\r\n        localStorage.setItem('scotch_auth_gcool_token', authResult.token);\r\n        localStorage.setItem('scotch_auth_gcool_id', authResult.id);\r\n      }\r\n      login() {\r\n        this.auth0.authorize();\r\n      }\r\n      logout(history) {\r\n        // Clear access token and ID token from local storage\r\n        localStorage.removeItem('scotch_auth_access_token');\r\n        localStorage.removeItem('scotch_auth_id_token');\r\n        localStorage.removeItem('scotch_auth_expires_at');\r\n        localStorage.removeItem('scotch_auth_profile');\r\n        localStorage.removeItem('scotch_auth_gcool_token');\r\n        localStorage.removeItem('scotch_auth_gcool_id');\r\n        // navigate to the home route\r\n        history.replace('/');\r\n      }\r\n      isAuthenticated() {\r\n        // Check whether the current time is past the\r\n        // access token's expiry time\r\n        const expiresAt = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('scotch_auth_expires_at'));\r\n        return new Date().getTime() &lt; expiresAt;\r\n      }\r\n      getProfile() {\r\n        return JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('scotch_auth_profile'));\r\n      }\r\n    }</code></pre><p>Let me take some time to walk you through what&rsquo;s going on:</p><ul><li>First thing we did is to create an instance of the Auth0 SDK and configured it using our Auth0 client credentials. This instance is then stored in the instance variable, <code>auth0</code></li><li><code>handleAuthentication</code> will be called by one of our components when authentication is completed. Auth0 will pass the token back to us through URL hash. This method reads and passes this hash.</li><li><code>storeAuth0Cred</code> and <code>storeGraphCoolCred</code> will persist our credentials to localStorage for future use.</li><li>We can call <code>isAuthenticated</code> to check if the token stored in localStorage is still valid.</li><li><code>getProfile</code> returns the JSON payload of the user&rsquo;s profile.</li></ul><p><strong>Callback page</strong>\r\nWe want to redirect the user to our profile page if they are authenticated or send them back to the home page (which is the default page) if they are not.

We need to setup this connection using Apollo and then provide the Apollo instance at the top level of our app.</p><p>Start with installing the required dependencies:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">yarn add apollo-client-preset react-apollo graphql-tag graphql</code></pre><p>Update the <code>src/index.js</code> entry file:</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">    import React from 'react';\r\n    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\r\n    import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';\r\n    import './index.css';\r\n    import App from './App';\r\n    import registerServiceWorker from './registerServiceWorker';\r\n    // Import modules\r\n    import { ApolloProvider } from 'react-apollo';\r\n    import { ApolloClient } from 'apollo-client';\r\n    import { HttpLink } from 'apollo-link-http';\r\n    import { InMemoryCache } from 'apollo-cache-inmemory';\r\n    // Create connection link\r\n    const httpLink = new HttpLink({ uri: '[SIMPLE API URL]' });\r\n    // Configure client with link\r\n    const client = new ApolloClient({\r\n      link: httpLink,\r\n      cache: new InMemoryCache()\r\n    });\r\n    // Render App component with Apollo provider\r\n    ReactDOM.render(\r\n      &lt;BrowserRouter>\r\n        &lt;ApolloProvider client={client}>\r\n          &lt;App />\r\n        &lt;/ApolloProvider>\r\n      &lt;/BrowserRouter>,\r\n      document.getElementById('root')\r\n    );\r\n    registerServiceWorker();</code></pre><p>First we imported all the dependencies, then created a link using <code>HttpLink</code>. The argument passed is an object with the URI. You can get your server&rsquo;s URI by running the following command on the server folder:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">graphcool-framework list</code></pre><p>Use the Simple URI to replace the placeholder in the code above.</p><p>Next we created and configured an Apollo client instance with this link as well as a cache. This created client instance is now passed as prop to the Apollo provider which wraps the <code>App</code> component.</p><h2>Test Authentication Flow</h2><p>Now that everything seems intact, let&rsquo;s add an event to the button on our navigation bar to trigger the auth process:</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">    //...\r\n    import Auth from '../services/auth'\r\n    const auth = new Auth();\r\n    const Nav = () => {\r\n      return (\r\n        &lt;nav className=\"navbar\">\r\n          ...\r\n          &lt;div className=\"navbar-menu\">\r\n            &lt;div className=\"navbar-end\">\r\n              ...\r\n              &lt;div className=\"navbar-item join\" onClick={() => {auth.login()}}>\r\n                Join\r\n              &lt;/div>\r\n            &lt;/div>\r\n          &lt;/div>\r\n        &lt;/nav>\r\n      );\r\n    };\r\n    export default Nav;</code></pre><p>When the Join button is clicked, we trigger the <code>auth.login</code> method which would redirect us to our Auth0 domain for authentication:</p><p><img data-src=\"https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_314FE62DA58A8C6BA53A9259B1A05DBDCF00D90AC3786DDEAAD8086A93E6258D_1516107290897_Screen+Shot+2018-01-16+at+4.03.36+AM.png\" alt=\"\"/><img/></p><p>After the user logs in, Auth0 would confirm from the user if (s)he wants you to access his/her profile information:</p><p>After authentication, watch the page move back to <code>/callback</code> and the <code>/profile</code> if authentication was successful.</p><p>You can also confirm that the user is created by going to the data view in your Graphcool dashboard and opening the Users table:</p><p><img data-src=\"https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_314FE62DA58A8C6BA53A9259B1A05DBDCF00D90AC3786DDEAAD8086A93E6258D_1516108557747_Screen+Shot+2018-01-16+at+1.54.21+PM.png\" alt=\"\"/><img/></p><h2>Conditional Buttons</h2><p>We should hide the login button when the user is authenticated and show the logout button rather. Back in the <code>nav.js</code> replace the Join button element with this conditional logic:</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">     {auth.isAuthenticated() ? (\r\n        &lt;div\r\n          className=\"navbar-item join\"\r\n          onClick={() => {\r\n            auth.logout();\r\n          }}\r\n        >\r\n          Logout\r\n        &lt;/div>\r\n      ) : (\r\n        &lt;div\r\n          className=\"navbar-item join\"\r\n          onClick={() => {\r\n            auth.login();\r\n          }}\r\n        >\r\n          Join\r\n        &lt;/div>\r\n      )}</code></pre><p>The <code>Auth</code> services exposes a method called <code>isAuthenticated</code> to check if the token is stored in the localStorage and not expired. Here is an image of the page showing that the user is logged in:</p><p><img data-src=\"https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_314FE62DA58A8C6BA53A9259B1A05DBDCF00D90AC3786DDEAAD8086A93E6258D_1516191614587_Screen+Shot+2018-01-16+at+8.33.59+PM.png\" alt=\"\"/><img/></p><h2>Displaying User&rsquo;s Profile</h2><p>You can also use the Auth service to retrieve a logged in user profile. This profile is already available in the localStorage:</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">    //...\r\n    import Auth from '../services/auth';\r\n    const auth = new Auth();\r\n    const Profile = props => (\r\n      &lt;div>\r\n        //...\r\n        &lt;h2 className=\"title\">Nickname: {auth.getProfile().nickname}&lt;/h2>\r\n      &lt;/div>\r\n    );\r\n    export default Profile;</code></pre><p>The nickname gets printed in the browser:</p><p><img data-src=\"https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_314FE62DA58A8C6BA53A9259B1A05DBDCF00D90AC3786DDEAAD8086A93E6258D_1516191672687_Screen+Shot+2018-01-16+at+8.36.39+PM.png\" alt=\"\"/><img/></p><h2>Securing Graphcool Endpoint</h2><p>We only accounted for generating tokens but what happens when a user tries to access a restricted backend route? Of course, an authenticated user will still have access because we haven&rsquo;t told the server about the token.</p><p>We can send the token as <code>Bearer</code> token in the header of our request. Update the <code>index.js</code> with the following:</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">    //...\r\n    import { ApolloLink } from 'apollo-client-preset'\r\n    const httpLink = new HttpLink({ uri: '[SIMPLE URL]' });\r\n    const middlewareAuthLink = new ApolloLink((operation, forward) => {\r\n      const token = localStorage.getItem('scotch_auth_gcool_token')\r\n      const authorizationHeader = token ? `Bearer ${token}` : null\r\n      operation.setContext({\r\n        headers: {\r\n          authorization: authorizationHeader\r\n        }\r\n      })\r\n      return forward(operation)\r\n    })\r\n    const httpLinkWithAuthToken = middlewareAuthLink.concat(httpLink)</code></pre><p>Instead of creating the Apollo client with just the HTTP Link, we update it to use the middleware we just created which adds a token to all server requests we make:</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">    const client = new ApolloClient({\r\n      link: httpLinkWithAuthToken,\r\n      cache: new InMemoryCache()\r\n    })</code></pre><p>You can then use the token at the server&rsquo;s end to validate the request.</p><h2>Protecting Routes</h2><p>In as much as you have done a great job by securing the most important part of your project which is the server and it&rsquo;s data, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to leave the user hanging at a route where there will be no content. The <code>/profile</code> route needs to be protected from being accessed when user is not authenticated.</p><p>Update <code>App.js</code> to redirect to the home page if the user goes to profile but not authenticated:</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">    //...\r\n    import { Switch, Route, Redirect } from 'react-router-dom';\r\n    //...\r\n    import Auth from './services/auth';\r\n    const auth = new Auth();\r\n    class App extends Component {\r\n      render() {\r\n        return (\r\n          &lt;div className=\"App\">\r\n            &lt;Switch>\r\n              &lt;Route exact path=\"/\" component={Home} />\r\n              &lt;Route exact path=\"/callback\" component={Callback} />\r\n              &lt;Route exact path=\"/about\" component={About} />\r\n              &lt;Route\r\n                exact\r\n                path=\"/profile\"\r\n                render={props =>\r\n                  auth.isAuthenticated() ? (\r\n                    &lt;Profile />\r\n                  ) : (\r\n                    &lt;Redirect\r\n                      to={{\r\n                        pathname: '/'\r\n                      }}\r\n                    />\r\n                  )\r\n                }\r\n              />\r\n            &lt;/Switch>\r\n          &lt;/div>\r\n        );\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    export default App;</code></pre><p>We are still using <code>auth.isAuthenticated</code> to check for authentication. If it returns true, <code>/profile</code> wins, else, <code>/</code> wins.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>We just learned how to authenticate a user using Auth0 in a GraphQL project. What you can do is go to your Auth0 dashboard and add few more social authentication options like Twitter. You will be asked for your Twitter developer credentials which can get from the Twitter Developer website.</p><img align=\"left\" border=\"0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/518136676/0/scotch_io\"/>"

Even on a pretty average mobile device, we can compile at 8 megabytes per second &mdash;which is faster than the average download speed for pretty much any mobile network.</p><p>This means your code executes almost as soon as it finishes downloading.</p><h3 id=\"1091\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Why is this important?</h3><p>Web performance advocates get prickly when sites ship a lot of JavaScript. That&rsquo;s because downloading lots of JavaScript makes pages load slower.</p><p>This is largely because of the parse and compile times. As <a href=\"https://calendar.perfplanet.com/2017/tracking-cpu-with-long-tasks-api/\">Steve Souders points out</a>, the old bottleneck for web performance used to be the network. But the new bottleneck for web performance is the CPU, and particularly the main thread.</p><p><a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/02.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-31713\" src=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/02-500x295.png\" alt=\"Old bottleneck, the network, on the left.

We also want to start it as early as possible so we&rsquo;re making use of all of the CPU&rsquo;s time. Even better, we can do less CPU work altogether.</p><p>With JavaScript, you can do some of this. You can parse files off of the main thread, as they stream in. But you&rsquo;re still parsing them, which is a lot of work, and you have to wait until they are parsed before you can start compiling. And for compiling, you&rsquo;re back on the main thread. This is because JS is usually <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/02/a-crash-course-in-just-in-time-jit-compilers/\">compiled lazily</a>, at runtime.</p><p><a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/03.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-31714\" src=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/03-500x167.png\" alt=\"Timeline showing packets coming in on the main thread, then parsing happening simultaneously on another thread.

Decoding WebAssembly is much simpler and faster than parsing JavaScript. And this decoding and the compilation can be split across multiple threads.</p><p>This means multiple threads will be doing the baseline compilation, which makes it faster. Once it&rsquo;s done, the baseline compiled code can start executing on the main thread. It won&rsquo;t have to pause for compilation, like the JS does.</p><p><a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/04.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-31715\" src=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/04-500x202.png\" alt=\"Timeline showing packets coming in on the main thread, and decoding and baseline compiling happening across multiple threads simultaneously, resulting in execution starting faster and without compiling breaks.\" width=\"500\" height=\"202\" srcset=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/04-500x202.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/04-250x101.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/04-768x310.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"/><img/></a></p><p>While the baseline compiled code is running on the main thread, other threads work on making a more optimized version. When the more optimized version is done, it can be swapped in so the code runs even faster.</p><p>This changes the cost of loading WebAssembly to be more like decoding an image than loading JavaScript. And think about it&hellip; web performance advocates do get prickly about JS payloads of 150 kB, but an image payload of the same size doesn&rsquo;t raise eyebrows.</p><p><a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/05.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-31716\" src=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/05-500x218.png\" alt=\"Developer advocate on the left tsk tsk-ing about large JS file.

While early WebAssembly tools created large files because they included lots of runtime, there&rsquo;s currently a lot of work to make these files smaller. For example, Emscripten has a <a href=\"https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/issues/5836\">&ldquo;shrinking initiative&rdquo;</a>. In Rust, you can already get pretty small file sizes using the wasm32-unknown-unkown target, and there are tools like <a href=\"https://github.com/alexcrichton/wasm-gc\">wasm-gc</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/fitzgen/wasm-snip\">wasm-snip</a> which can optimize this even more.</p><p>What it does mean is that these WebAssembly files will load much faster than the equivalent JavaScript.</p><p>This is big. As <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wycats/status/942908325775077376\">Yehuda Katz points out</a>, this is a game changer.</p><p><a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/06.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-31717\" src=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/06-500x444.png\" alt=\"Tweet from Yehuda Katz saying it&apos;s possible to parse and compile wasm as fast as it comes over the network.\" width=\"500\" height=\"444\" srcset=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/06-500x444.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/06-250x222.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/06-768x682.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"/><img/></a></p><p>So let&rsquo;s look at how the new compiler works.</p><h3 id=\"4ad4\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Streaming compilation: start compiling earlier</h3><p>If you start compiling the code earlier, you&rsquo;ll finish compiling it earlier. That&rsquo;s what streaming compilation does&hellip; makes it possible to start compiling the&nbsp;.wasm file as soon as possible.</p><p>When you download a file, it doesn&rsquo;t come down in one piece. Instead, it comes down in a series of packets.</p><p>Before, as each packet in the&nbsp;.wasm file was being downloaded, the browser network layer would put it into an ArrayBuffer.</p><p><a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/07.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-31718\" src=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/07-500x255.png\" alt=\"Packets coming in to network layer and being added to an ArrayBuffer\" width=\"500\" height=\"255\" srcset=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/07-500x255.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/07-250x127.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/07-768x392.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"/><img/></a></p><p>Then, once that was done, it would move that ArrayBuffer over to the Web VM (aka the JS engine). That&rsquo;s when the WebAssembly compiler would start compiling.</p><p><a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/08.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-31719\" src=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/08-500x218.png\" alt=\"Network layer pushing array buffer over to compiler\" width=\"500\" height=\"218\" srcset=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/08-500x218.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/08-250x109.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/08-768x334.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"/><img/></a></p><p>But there&rsquo;s no good reason to keep the compiler waiting. It&rsquo;s technically possible to compile WebAssembly line by line. This means you should be able to start as soon as the first chunk comes in.</p><p>So that&rsquo;s what our new compiler does. It takes advantage of WebAssembly&rsquo;s streaming API.</p><p><a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/09.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-31720\" src=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/09-500x132.png\" alt=\"WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming call, which takes a response object with the source file.

Then the compiler can start working on the first chunk while the next one is still being downloaded.</p><p><a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/10.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-31721\" src=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/10-500x248.png\" alt=\"Packets going directly to compiler\" width=\"500\" height=\"248\" srcset=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/10-500x248.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/10-250x124.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/10-768x380.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"/><img/></a></p><p>Besides being able to download and compile the code in parallel, there&rsquo;s another advantage to this.</p><p>The code section of the&nbsp;.wasm module comes before any data (which will go in the module&rsquo;s memory object). So by streaming, the compiler can compile the code while the module&rsquo;s data is still being downloaded. If your module needs a lot of data, the data can be megabytes, so this can be significant.</p><p><a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/11.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-31722\" src=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/11-500x260.png\" alt=\"File split between small code section at the top, and larger data section at the bottom\" width=\"500\" height=\"260\" srcset=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/11-500x260.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/11-250x130.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/11-768x399.png 768w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/11.png 1550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"/><img/></a></p><p>With streaming, we start compiling earlier. But we can also make compiling faster.</p><h3 id=\"23fa\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Tier 1 baseline compiler: compile code&nbsp;faster</h3><p>If you want code to run fast, you need to optimize it. But performing these optimizations while you&rsquo;re compiling takes time, which makes compiling the code slower. So there&rsquo;s a tradeoff.</p><p>We can have the best of both of these worlds. If we use two compilers, we can have one that compiles quickly without too many optimizations, and another that compiles the code more slowly but creates more optimized code.</p><p>This is called a tiered compiler. When code first comes in, it&rsquo;s compiled by the Tier 1 (or baseline) compiler. Then, after the baseline compiled code starts running, a Tier 2 compiler goes through the code again and compiles a more optimized version in the background.</p><p>Once it&rsquo;s done, it hot-swaps the optimized code in for the previous baseline version. This makes the code execute faster.</p><p><a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/12.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-31723\" src=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/12-500x204.png\" alt=\"Timeline showing optimizing compiling happening in the background.\" width=\"500\" height=\"204\" srcset=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/12-500x204.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/12-250x102.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/12-768x313.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"/><img/></a></p><p>JavaScript engines have been using tiered compilers for a long time. However, JS engines will only use the Tier 2 (or optimizing) compiler when a bit of code gets &ldquo;warm&rdquo;&hellip; when that part of the code gets called a lot.</p><p>In contrast, the WebAssembly Tier 2 compiler will eagerly do a full recompilation, optimizing all of the code in the module. In the future, we may add more options for developers to control how eagerly or lazily optimization is done.</p><p>This baseline compiler saves a lot of time at startup. It compiles code 10&ndash;15 times faster than the optimizing compiler. And the code it creates is, in our tests, only 2 times slower.</p><p>This means your code will be running pretty fast even in those first few moments, when it&rsquo;s still running the baseline compiled code.</p><h3 id=\"0453\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Parallelize: make it all even&nbsp;faster</h3><p>In the <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/11/entering-the-quantum-era-how-firefox-got-fast-again-and-where-its-going-to-get-faster/\">article on Firefox Quantum</a>, I explained coarse-grained and fine-grained parallelization. We use both for compiling WebAssembly.</p><p>I mentioned above that the optimizing compiler will do its compilation in the background. This means that it leaves the main thread available to execute the code. The baseline compiled version of the code can run while the optimizing compiler does its recompilation.</p><p>But on most computers that still leaves multiple cores unused. To make the best use of all of the cores, both of the compilers use fine-grained parallelization to split up the work.</p><p>The unit of parallelization is the function. Each function can be compiled independently, on a different core. This is so fine-grained, in fact, that we actually need to batch these functions up into larger groups of functions. These batches get sent to different cores.</p><h3 id=\"5175\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">&hellip; then skip all that work entirely by caching it implicitly (future&nbsp;work)</h3><p>Currently, decoding and compiling are redone every time you reload the page. But if you have the same&nbsp;.wasm file, it should compile to the same machine code.</p><p>This means that most of the time, this work could be skipped. And in the future, this is what we&rsquo;ll do. We&rsquo;ll decode and compile on first page load, and then cache the resulting machine code in the HTTP cache. Then when you request that URL, it will pull out the precompiled machine code.</p><p>This makes load time disappear for subsequent page loads.</p><p><a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/13.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-31724\" src=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/13-500x217.png\" alt=\"Timeline showing all work disappearing with caching.\" width=\"500\" height=\"217\" srcset=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/13-500x217.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/13-250x109.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/01/13-768x334.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"/><img/></a></p><p>The groundwork is already laid for this feature. We&rsquo;re <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/javascript/2017/12/12/javascript-startup-bytecode-cache/\">caching JavaScript byte code like this</a> in the Firefox 58 release. We just need to extend this support to caching the machine code for&nbsp;.wasm files.</p>"

I&rsquo;ll explain why we do this in a moment.</p><p>For now, in order to get it working and testable, we&rsquo;re going to write it in the portal and fill in the request body to perform the test. But we need to know what Stripe will expect from us first.</p><p><em>Dun dun dun...</em></p><h3>Working With Stripe as a Serverless Function</h3><p>If you check out <a href=\"https://stripe.com/docs/checkout/express\">Stripe's documentation</a>, you can see that we&rsquo;ll need to grab the Stripe token in the dashboard. This will eventually mirror the POST parameters submitted by our form. Stripe makes it easy, so it's fairly straightforward to use their library for the server-side function with Express:</p><pre rel=\"JavaScript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\">app.get('/', (req, res) => res.render('index.pug', { keyPublishable }));\n\napp.post('/charge', (req, res) => {\n  let amount = 500;\n\n  stripe.customers\n    .create({\n      email: req.body.stripeEmail,\n      source: req.body.stripeToken\n    })\n    .then(customer =>\n      stripe.charges.create({\n        amount,\n        description: 'Sample Charge',\n        currency: 'usd',\n        customer: customer.id\n      })\n    )\n    .then(charge => res.render('charge.pug'));\n});\n\napp.listen(4567);</code></pre><p>We won&rsquo;t need to set up all of Node and Express for this, though, as what we really need is the amount, the currency, the description, and the token, which we can integrate with the testing code we were provided earlier in the portal's view of our function. So, let&rsquo;s head over to the <a href=\"https://aka.ms/W6ft1h\">Azure portal</a> where our function lives and update that default testing code to accept the parameters we need for Stripe, and also populate the <code>request.body</code> in the test panel.</p><p>We&rsquo;ll add our Stripe testing key and kick everything off. To be totally sure, we&rsquo;re going to log what we&rsquo;ve gotten started:</p><pre rel=\"JavaScript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\">var stripe = require('stripe')('sk_test_whateveryourtestingkeyisgoeshere');\n// ^ this is a stripe testing key\n\nmodule.exports = function(context, req) {\n  context.log('starting to get down');</code></pre><p>If we have a request body, an email, and a token, then let's get started. We&rsquo;ll create a customer from the email and then use that customer to create the Stripe charges, passing in the amount of the charge as we do so.</p><pre rel=\"JavaScript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\">if (\n  req.body &amp;&amp;\n  req.body.stripeEmail &amp;&amp;\n  req.body.stripeToken &amp;&amp;\n  req.body.stripeAmt\n){\n  stripe.customers\n    .create({\n      email: req.body.stripeEmail,\n      source: req.body.stripeToken\n    })\n    .then(customer => {\n      context.log('starting the stripe charges');\n      stripe.charges.create({\n        amount: req.body.stripeAmt,\n        description: 'Sample Charge',\n        currency: 'usd',\n        customer: customer.id\n      });\n    })\n      ...</code></pre><p>We also want to test if this all completed successfully, or if it errored out. If it did error, we need to log what that error is. We&rsquo;ll also see if the whole thing errored entirely, making sure we&rsquo;re logging everything appropriately along the way. </p><p class=\"explanation\">You'll note that I log a lot. I think it's not enough to know that something has errored. I want to know when the error happened and why so that I can track it down. This makes it much easier to debug if something were to go wrong.</p><pre rel=\"JavaScript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\">      ...\n      .then(charge => {\n        context.log('finished the stripe charges');\n        context.res = {\n          // status: 200\n          body: 'This has been completed'\n        };\n        context.done();\n      })\n      .catch(err => {\n        context.log(err);\n        context.done();\n      });\n  } else {\n    context.log(req.body);\n    context.res = {\n      status: 400,\n      body: \"We're missing something\"\n    };\n    context.done();\n  }\n};</code></pre><p>In the testing area on the right side of <a href=\"https://aka.ms/Vcsomc\">the portal</a>, we&rsquo;ll fill the <code>request.body</code> with the <code>stripeEmail</code>, <code>stripeToken</code> (a testing token in this case), and some random amount for the charge. When we run this, we can see that it works! We get a <span style=\"color:green\">200 OK Status</span>, and we&rsquo;ve logged <code>This has been completed</code> in the output.</p><figure id=\"post-263607\" class=\"align-right media-263607\"><img src=\"https://cdn.css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/test-function-params.jpg\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/css-tricks/image/upload/c_scale, https://css-tricks.com/creating-vue-js-serverless-checkout-part-two/w_1000, https://css-tricks.com/creating-vue-js-serverless-checkout-part-two/f_auto, https://css-tricks.com/creating-vue-js-serverless-checkout-part-two/q_auto/v1512763384/test-function-params_oj3jg8.jpg 1000w, https://res.cloudinary.com/css-tricks/image/upload/c_scale, https://css-tricks.com/creating-vue-js-serverless-checkout-part-two/w_988, https://css-tricks.com/creating-vue-js-serverless-checkout-part-two/f_auto, https://css-tricks.com/creating-vue-js-serverless-checkout-part-two/q_auto/v1512763384/test-function-params_oj3jg8.jpg 988w, https://res.cloudinary.com/css-tricks/image/upload/c_scale, https://css-tricks.com/creating-vue-js-serverless-checkout-part-two/w_902, https://css-tricks.com/creating-vue-js-serverless-checkout-part-two/f_auto, https://css-tricks.com/creating-vue-js-serverless-checkout-part-two/q_auto/v1512763384/test-function-params_oj3jg8.jpg 902w, https://res.cloudinary.com/css-tricks/image/upload/c_scale, https://css-tricks.com/creating-vue-js-serverless-checkout-part-two/w_731, https://css-tricks.com/creating-vue-js-serverless-checkout-part-two/f_auto, https://css-tricks.com/creating-vue-js-serverless-checkout-part-two/q_auto/v1512763384/test-function-params_oj3jg8.jpg 731w, https://res.cloudinary.com/css-tricks/image/upload/c_scale, https://css-tricks.com/creating-vue-js-serverless-checkout-part-two/w_596, https://css-tricks.com/creating-vue-js-serverless-checkout-part-two/f_auto, https://css-tricks.com/creating-vue-js-serverless-checkout-part-two/q_auto/v1512763384/test-function-params_oj3jg8.jpg 596w, https://res.cloudinary.com/css-tricks/image/upload/c_scale, https://css-tricks.com/creating-vue-js-serverless-checkout-part-two/w_433, https://css-tricks.com/creating-vue-js-serverless-checkout-part-two/f_auto, https://css-tricks.com/creating-vue-js-serverless-checkout-part-two/q_auto/v1512763384/test-function-params_oj3jg8.jpg 433w, https://res.cloudinary.com/css-tricks/image/upload/c_scale, https://css-tricks.com/creating-vue-js-serverless-checkout-part-two/w_200, https://css-tricks.com/creating-vue-js-serverless-checkout-part-two/f_auto, https://css-tricks.com/creating-vue-js-serverless-checkout-part-two/q_auto/v1512763384/test-function-params_oj3jg8.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1850px) calc( (100vw - 555px) / 3 )&#10;       (min-width: 1251px) calc( (100vw - 530px) / 2 )&#10;       (min-width: 1086px) calc(100vw - 480px)&#10;       (min-width: 626px)  calc(100vw - 335px)&#10;                           calc(100vw - 30px)\" alt=\"actual function with testing request body params\"/><img/><figcaption>Testing the request body parameters with the actual function in Azure.</figcaption></figure><h3>Github-Hosted Serverless Function</h3><p>Let's put everything in Github now that it's working. One big reason we want to do this is because our function will have a dependency on Stripe&rsquo;s library. If you head over to the <a href=\"https://github.com/sdras/sample-stripe-handler/\">sample-stripe-handler</a> repo I&rsquo;ve created for this tutorial, you&rsquo;ll see a <code>package.json</code> file. The most important lines in that file are these:</p><pre rel=\"JSON\"><code class=\"language-javascript\">\"dependencies\": {\n  \"stripe\": \"^5.3.0\"\n}</code></pre><p>This tells the function to pull in the correct version of the Stripe API that we need to use in order for our app to properly function.
