A to-do list application is one practical example of a JavaScript program in which you would need to be able to create, modify, and remove elements in the DOM.</p><p>In this tutorial, we will go over how to create new nodes and insert them into the DOM, replace existing nodes, and remove nodes.</p><h2 id=\"creating-new-nodes\">Creating New Nodes</h2><p>In a static website, elements are added to the page by directly writing HTML in an <code>.html</code> file. In a dynamic web app, elements and text are often added with JavaScript.

The methods <code>appendChild()</code> and <code>insertBefore()</code> are used to add items to the beginning, middle, or end of a parent element, and <code>replaceChild()</code> is used to replace an old node with a new node.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Property/Method</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/appendChild\"><code>node.appendChild()</code></a></td><td>Add a node as the last child of a parent element</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/insertBefore\"><code>node.insertBefore()</code></a></td><td>Insert a node into the parent element before a specified sibling node</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/replaceChild\"><code>node.replaceChild()</code></a></td><td>Replace an existing node with a new node</td></tr></tbody></table><p>To practice these methods, let's create a to-do list in HTML:</p><div class=\"code-label \" title=\"todo.html\">todo.html</div><pre class=\"code-pre \"><code class=\"code-highlight language-html\">&lt;ul>\n  &lt;li>Buy groceries&lt;/li>\n  &lt;li>Feed the cat&lt;/li>\n  &lt;li>Do laundry&lt;/li>\n&lt;/ul>\n</code></pre><p>When you load your page in the browser, it will look like this:</p><p><img src=\"https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/eng_javascript/dom/to-do-1.png\" alt=\"DOM Screenshot 1\"/></p><p>In order to add a new item to the end of the to-do list, we have to create the element and add text to it first, as we did in the \"Creating New Nodes\" section above.</p><pre class=\"code-pre custom_prefix\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"&gt;\">// To-do list ul element\n</li><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"&gt;\">const todoList = document.querySelector('ul');\n</li><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"&gt;\"></li><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"&gt;\">// Create new to-do\n</li><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"&gt;\">const newTodo = document.createElement('li');\n</li><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"&gt;\">newTodo.textContent = 'Do homework';\n</li></ul></code></pre><p>Now that we have a complete element for our new to-do, we can add it to the end of the list with <code>appendChild()</code>.</p><pre class=\"code-pre custom_prefix\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"&gt;\">// Add new todo to the end of the list\n</li><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"&gt;\">todoList.appendChild(newTodo);\n</li></ul></code></pre><p>You can see the new <code>li</code> element has been appended to the end of the <code>ul</code>.</p><div class=\"code-label \" title=\"todo.html\">todo.html</div><pre class=\"code-pre \"><code class=\"code-highlight language-html\">&lt;ul>\n  &lt;li>Buy groceries&lt;/li>\n  &lt;li>Feed the cat&lt;/li>\n  &lt;li>Do laundry&lt;/li>\n  &lt;li>Do homework&lt;/li>\n&lt;/ul>\n</code></pre><p><img src=\"https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/eng_javascript/dom/to-do-2.png\" alt=\"DOM Screenshot 2\"/></p><p>Maybe we have a higher priority task to do, and we want to add it to the beginning of the list.

This method takes two arguments &mdash; the first is the new child node to be added, and the second is the sibling node that will immediately follow the new node. In other words, you're inserting the new node before the next sibling node. This will look similar to the following pseudocode:</p><pre class=\"code-pre \"><code class=\"code-highlight language-js\">parentNode.insertBefore(newNode, nextSibling);\n</code></pre><p>For our to-do list example, we'll add the new <code>anotherTodo</code> element before the first element child of the list, which is currently the <code>Buy groceries</code> list item.</p><pre class=\"code-pre custom_prefix\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"&gt;\">// Add new to-do to the beginning of the list\n</li><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"&gt;\">todoList.insertBefore(anotherTodo, todoList.firstElementChild);\n</li></ul></code></pre><div class=\"code-label \" title=\"todo.html\">todo.html</div><pre class=\"code-pre \"><code class=\"code-highlight language-html\">&lt;ul>\n  &lt;li>Pay bills&lt;/li>\n  &lt;li>Buy groceries&lt;/li>\n  &lt;li>Feed the cat&lt;/li>\n  &lt;li>Do laundry&lt;/li>\n  &lt;li>Do homework&lt;/li>\n&lt;/ul>\n</code></pre><p><img src=\"https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/eng_javascript/dom/to-do-3.png\" alt=\"DOM Screenshot 3\"/></p><p>The new node has successfully been added at the beginning of the list. Now we know how to add a node to a parent element. The next thing we may want to do is replace an existing node with a new node.</p><p>We'll modify an existing to-do to demonstrate how to replace a node. The first step of creating a new element remains the same.</p><pre class=\"code-pre custom_prefix\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"&gt;\">const modifiedTodo = document.createElement('li');\n</li><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"&gt;\">modifiedTodo.textContent = 'Feed the dog';\n</li></ul></code></pre><p>Like <code>insertBefore()</code>, <code>replaceChild()</code> takes two arguments &mdash; the new node, and the node to be replaced, as shown in the pseudocode below.</p><pre class=\"code-pre \"><code class=\"code-highlight language-js\">parentNode.replaceChild(newNode, oldNode);\n</code></pre><p>We will replace the third element child of the list with the modified to-do.</p><pre class=\"code-pre custom_prefix\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"&gt;\">// Replace existing to-do with modified to-do\n</li><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"&gt;\">todoList.replaceChild(modifiedTodo, todoList.children[2]);\n</li></ul></code></pre><div class=\"code-label \" title=\"todo.html\">todo.html</div><pre class=\"code-pre \"><code class=\"code-highlight language-html\">&lt;ul>\n  &lt;li>Pay bills&lt;/li>\n  &lt;li>Buy groceries&lt;/li>\n  &lt;li>Feed the dog&lt;/li>\n  &lt;li>Do laundry&lt;/li>\n  &lt;li>Do homework&lt;/li>\n&lt;/ul>\n</code></pre><p><img src=\"https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/eng_javascript/dom/to-do-4.png\" alt=\"DOM Screenshot 4\"/></p><p>With a combination of <code>appendChild()</code>, <code>insertBefore()</code>, and <code>replaceChild()</code>, you can insert nodes and elements anywhere in the DOM.</p><h2 id=\"removing-nodes-from-the-dom\">Removing Nodes from the DOM</h2><p>Now we know how to create elements, add them to the DOM, and modify existing elements. The final step is to learn to remove existing nodes from the DOM. Child nodes can be removed from a parent with <code>removeChild()</code>, and a node itself can be removed with <code>remove()</code>.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Method</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/removeChild\"><code>node.removeChild()</code></a></td><td>Remove child node</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ChildNode/remove\"><code>node.remove()</code></a></td><td>Remove node</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Using the to-do example above, we'll want to delete items after they've been completed.

Another method you may see for removing child elements from the DOM is setting the <code>innerHTML</code> property of a parent element to an empty string (<code>\"\"</code>). This is not the preferred method because it is less explicit, but you might see it in existing code.</p><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>In this tutorial, we learned how to use JavaScript to create new nodes and elements and insert them into the DOM, and replace and remove existing nodes and elements.</p><p>At this point in the <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/understanding-the-dom-document-object-model\">Understanding the DOM series</a> you know how to access any element in the DOM, walk through any node in the DOM, and modify the DOM itself.

If you don't already have one, you can register on the <a href=\"https://cloud.digitalocean.com/registrations/new\">signup page</a>. </p><p>From there, you&rsquo;ll need to set up your DigitalOcean Space and create an API key, which you can achieve by following our tutorial <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-digitalocean-space-and-api-key\">How To Create a DigitalOcean Space and API Key</a>.</p><p>Once created, you&rsquo;ll need to keep the following details about your Space handy:</p><ul><li>Access Key</li><li>Secret Key (also called token)</li></ul><p>Additionally, you should have an Ubuntu 16.04 server set up with a sudo non-root user. You can get guidance for setting this up by following <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-16-04\">this Ubuntu 16.04 initial server setup tutorial</a>.</p><p>Once you have your Spaces information and server set up, proceed to the next section to install Git.</p><h2 id=\"install-git\">Install Git</h2><p>In this tutorial, we&rsquo;ll be working with a remote Git repository that we&rsquo;ll clone to our server. Ubuntu has Git installed and ready to use in its default repositories, but this version may be older than the most recent available release. </p><p>We can use the <code>apt</code> package management tools to update the local package index and to download and install the most recent available version of Git. </p><pre class=\"code-pre command\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">sudo apt-get update\n</li><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">sudo apt-get install git\n</li></ul></code></pre><p>For a more flexible way to install Git and to ensure that you have the latest release, you can consider <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-git-on-ubuntu-16-04#how-to-install-git-from-source\">installing Git from Source</a>.</p><p>We&rsquo;ll be backing up from a Git repository&rsquo;s URL, so we will not need to configure Git in this tutorial. For guidance on configuring Git, read this section on <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-git-on-ubuntu-16-04#how-to-set-up-git\">How To Set Up Git</a>. </p><p>Now we&rsquo;ll move on to cloning our remote Git repository. </p><h2 id=\"clone-a-remote-git-repository\">Clone a Remote Git Repository</h2><p>In order to clone our Git repository, we&rsquo;ll create a script to perform the task. Creating a script allows us to use variables and helps ensure that we do not make errors on the command line. </p><p>To write our executable script, we&rsquo;ll create a new shell script file called <code><span class=\"highlight\">cloneremote</span>.sh</code> with the text editor nano.</p><pre class=\"code-pre command\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">nano <span class=\"highlight\">cloneremote</span>.sh\n</li></ul></code></pre><p>Within this blank file, let&rsquo;s write the following script.</p><div class=\"code-label \" title=\"cloneremote.sh\">cloneremote.sh</div><pre class=\"code-pre \"><code langs=\"\">#!/bin/bash\n\nremoterepo=<span class=\"highlight\">your_remote_repository_url</span>\nlocalclonedir=<span class=\"highlight\">repos</span>\nclonefilename=<span class=\"highlight\">demoprojectlocal</span>.git\n\ngit clone --mirror $remoterepo $localclonedir/$clonefilename\n</code></pre><p>Let&rsquo;s walk through each element of this script. </p><p>The first line &mdash; <code>#!/bin/bash</code> &mdash; indicates that the script will be run by the Bash shell. From there, we define the variables that will be used in the command, which will run once we execute the script. These variables define the following pieces of configuration:</p><ul><li><code>remoterepo</code> is being assigned the remote Git repository URL that we will be backing up from</li><li><code>localclonedir</code> refers to the server directory or folder that we will be cloning the remote repository into, in this case we have called it <code><span class=\"highlight\">repos</span></code></li><li><code>clonefilename</code> refers to the filename we will provide to the local cloned repository, in this case we have called it <code><span class=\"highlight\">demoprojectlocal</span>.git</code></li></ul><p>Each of these variables are then called directly in the command at the end of the script.</p><p>The last line of the script uses the Git command line client beginning with the <code>git</code> command. From there, we are requesting to clone a repository with <code>clone</code>, and executing it as a mirror version of the repository with the <code>--mirror</code> tag. This means that the cloned repository will be exactly the same as the original one. The three variables that we defined above are called with <code>$</code>. </p><p>When you are satisfied that the script you have written is accurate, you can exit nano by typing the <code>CTRL</code> + <code>x</code> keys, and when prompted to save the file press <code>y</code>. </p><p>At this point we can run the shell script with the following command.</p><pre class=\"code-pre command\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">sh <span class=\"highlight\">cloneremote</span>.sh\n</li></ul></code></pre><p>Once you run the command, you&rsquo;ll receive output similar to the following.</p><pre class=\"code-pre \"><code langs=\"\"><div class=\"secondary-code-label \" title=\"Output\">Output</div>Cloning into bare repository './<span class=\"highlight\">repos</span>/<span class=\"highlight\">demoprojectlocal</span>.git'...\nremote: Counting objects: 3, done.\nremote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)\nReceiving objects: 100% (3/3), done.\nChecking connectivity... done.\n</code></pre><p>At this point, if you list the items in your current directory, you should see your backup directory there, and if you move into that directory you&rsquo;ll see the sub-folder with the filename that you provided in the script. That subdirectory is the clone of the Git repository. </p><p>With our remote Git repository cloned, we can now move on to installing S3cmd, which we can use to backup the repository into object storage. </p><h2 id=\"install-s3cmd\">Install S3cmd</h2><p>The S3cmd tool allows us to connect to the Spaces environment from the command line. We&rsquo;ll download the latest version of S3cmd from its <a href=\"https://github.com/s3tools/s3cmd\">public GitHub repository</a> and follow the recommended guidelines for installing it.</p><p>Before installing S3cmd, we need to install Python&rsquo;s Setuptools, as it will help with our installation (S3cmd is written in Python).</p><pre class=\"code-pre command\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">sudo apt-get install python-setuptools\n</li></ul></code></pre><p>Press <code>y</code> to continue.</p><p>With this downloaded, we can now download the S3cmd <code>tar.gz</code> file with <code>curl</code>.</p><pre class=\"code-pre command\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">cd /tmp\n</li><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">curl -LO https://github.com/s3tools/s3cmd/releases/download/<span class=\"highlight\">v2.0.1</span>/s3cmd-<span class=\"highlight\">2.0.1</span>.tar.gz\n</li></ul></code></pre><p>Note that we are downloading the file into our <code>tmp</code> directory. This a common practice when downloading files onto our server. </p><p>You can check to see if there is a newer version of S3cmd available by visiting the <a href=\"https://github.com/s3tools/s3cmd/releases\">Releases page</a> of the tool&rsquo;s GitHub repository. If you find a newer version, you can copy the <code>tar.gz</code> URL and substitute it into the <code>curl</code> command above.</p><p>When the download has completed, unzip and unpack the file using the tar utility:</p><pre class=\"code-pre command\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">cd ~\n</li><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">tar xf /tmp/s3cmd-*.tar.gz\n</li></ul></code></pre><p>In the commands above, we changed back to our home directory then executed the <code>tar</code> command. We used two flags with the command, the <code>x</code> indicates that we want to e<strong>x</strong>tract from a tar file and, and the <code>f</code> indicates that the immediately adjacent string will be the full path name of the file that we want to expand from. In the file path of the tar file, we also indicate that it is in the <code>tmp</code> directory.</p><p>Once the file is extracted, change into the resulting directory and install the software using sudo:</p><pre class=\"code-pre command\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">cd s3cmd-*\n</li><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">sudo python setup.py install\n</li></ul></code></pre><p>For the above command to run, we need to use <code>sudo</code>. The <code>python</code> command is a call to the Python interpreter to install the <code>setup.py</code> Python script.</p><p>Test the install by asking S3cmd for its version information:</p><pre class=\"code-pre command\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">s3cmd --version\n</li></ul></code></pre><pre class=\"code-pre \"><code langs=\"\"><div class=\"secondary-code-label \" title=\"Output\">Output</div>s3cmd version <span class=\"highlight\">2.0.1</span></code></pre><p>If you see similar output, S3cmd has been successfully installed. Next, we'll configure S3cmd to connect to our object storage service.</p><h2 id=\"configure-s3cmd\">Configure S3cmd</h2><p>S3cmd has an interactive configuration process that can create the configuration file we need to connect to our object storage server. During the configuration process, you will be asked for your Access Key and Secret Key, so have them readily available.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s start the configuration process by typing the following command:</p><pre class=\"code-pre command\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">s3cmd --configure\n</li></ul></code></pre><p>We are prompted to enter our keys, so let&rsquo;s paste them in and then accept <code>US</code> for the <strong>Default Region</strong>. It is worth noting that being able to modify the Default Region is relevant for the AWS infrastructure that the S3cmd tool was originally created to work with. Because DigitalOcean requires fewer pieces of information for configuration, this is not relevant so we accept the default. </p><pre class=\"code-pre \"><code langs=\"\">Enter new values or accept defaults in brackets with Enter.\nRefer to user manual for detailed description of all options.\nAccess key and Secret key are your identifiers for Amazon S3.

When the test completes successfully, enter <code>Y</code> to save the settings.</p><p>Once you save the configuration, you'll receive confirmation of its location.</p><p>When you have completed all the installation steps, you can double-check that your setup is correct by running the following command.</p><pre class=\"code-pre command\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">s3cmd ls\n</li></ul></code></pre><p>This command should output a list of Spaces that you have available under the credentials you provided.</p><pre class=\"code-pre \"><code langs=\"\"><div class=\"secondary-code-label \" title=\"Output\">Output</div>2017-12-15 02:52  s3://<span class=\"highlight\">demospace</span></code></pre><p>This confirms that we have successfully connected to our DigitalOcean Spaces. We can now move on to backing up our Git repository into object storage.</p><h2 id=\"backup-git-repository-into-object-storage\">Backup Git Repository into Object Storage</h2><p>With all of our tools installed and configured, we are now going to create a script that will zip the local repository and push it into our DigitalOcean Space.</p><p>From our home directory, let&rsquo;s call our script <code><span class=\"highlight\">movetospaces</span>.sh</code> and open it in nano.</p><pre class=\"code-pre command\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">cd ~\n</li><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">nano <span class=\"highlight\">movetospaces</span>.sh\n</li></ul></code></pre><p>We&rsquo;ll write our script as follows.</p><div class=\"code-label \" title=\"movetospaces.sh\">movetospaces.sh</div><pre class=\"code-pre \"><code langs=\"\">#!/bin/sh\n\ntar -zcvf <span class=\"highlight\">archivedemoproject</span>.tar.gz /<span class=\"highlight\">repos</span>/<span class=\"highlight\">demoprojectlocal</span>.git\n./s3cmd-<span class=\"highlight\">2.0.1</span>/s3cmd put <span class=\"highlight\">archivedemoproject</span>.tar.gz s3://<span class=\"highlight\">demospace</span></code></pre><p>Earlier in this tutorial, we&rsquo;ve used <code>tar</code> to unzip <code>s3cmd</code>, we are now using <code>tar</code> to zip the Git repository before sending it to Spaces. In the <code>tar</code> command, we specify four flags:</p><ul><li><code>z</code> compresses using the gzip method</li><li><code>c</code> creates a new file instead of using an existing one</li><li><code>v</code> indicates that we are being verbose about the files being included in the compressed file</li><li><code>f</code> names the resulting file with the name defined in the next string </li></ul><p>After the flags, we are providing a file name for the compressed file, in this case <code><span class=\"highlight\">archivedemoproject</span>.tar.gz</code>. We are also providing the name of the directory that we want to zip <code>/<span class=\"highlight\">repos</span>/<span class=\"highlight\">demoprojectlocal</span>.git</code>. </p><p>The script then executes <code>s3cmd put</code> to send <code><span class=\"highlight\">archivedemoproject</span>.tar.gz</code> to our destination Space <code>s3://<span class=\"highlight\">demospace</span></code>. </p><p>Among the commands you may commonly use with S3cmd, the <code>put</code> command sends files to Spaces. Other commands that may be useful include the <code>get</code> command to download files from the Space, and the <code>delete</code> command to delete files. You can obtain a list of all commands accepted by S3cmd by executing <code>s3cmd</code> with no options.</p><p>To copy your backup into your Space, we&rsquo;ll execute the script. </p><pre class=\"code-pre command\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">sh <span class=\"highlight\">movetospaces</span>.sh\n</li></ul></code></pre><p>You will see the following output:</p><pre class=\"code-pre \"><code langs=\"\"><div class=\"secondary-code-label \" title=\"Output\">Output</div><span class=\"highlight\">demoprojectlocal</span>.git/\n...\n<span class=\"highlight\">demoprojectlocal</span>.git/packed-refs\nupload: '<span class=\"highlight\">archivedemoproject</span>.tar.gz' -> 's3://<span class=\"highlight\">demobucket</span>/<span class=\"highlight\">archivedemoproject</span>.tar.gz'  [1 of 1]\n 6866 of 6866   100% in    0s    89.77 kB/s  done\n</code></pre><p>You can check that the process worked correctly by running the following command:</p><pre class=\"code-pre command\"><code langs=\"\"><ul class=\"prefixed\"><li class=\"line\" prefix=\"$\">s3cmd ls s3://<span class=\"highlight\">demospace</span></li></ul></code></pre><p>You&rsquo;ll see the following output, indicating that the file is in your Space.</p><pre class=\"code-pre \"><code langs=\"\"><div class=\"secondary-code-label \" title=\"Output\">Output</div>2017-12-18 20:31      6866   s3://<span class=\"highlight\">demospace</span>/<span class=\"highlight\">archivedemoproject</span>.tar.gz\n</code></pre><p>We now have successfully backed up our Git repository into our DigitalOcean Space. </p><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>To ensure that code can be quickly recovered if needed, it is important to maintain backups.

To be honest, I'm pretty compulsive obsessive about the whole thing. I can watch YouTube videos for hours studying how each works and why people like them. One question that I really wanted to tackle is \"Are there ways in which VS Code is actually better (i.e. more productive) than WebStorm, PyCharm, IntelliJ, etc.\" <br/><br/>I think this video <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6OhcGt5js4\">Moving from WebStorm to VSCode</a> does a pretty good job tackling this question, but I remain unconvinced. <br/><br/>I think there are three things I miss the most in VS Code compared to PyCharm, WebStorm, IntelliJ, etc.: <br/><br/>1. The Find window is much better in PyCharm. I can search for something in order to do a cross-project refactor. As I go through each entry, I don't lose my place in the find results, even if I have to edit the code for a few minutes. (Trying to do the same in VS Code is a fairly frustrating experience.) If I need to search for something else, I can save the results in a new tab without losing the original search. This is really important if the refactor takes me a few days, and I need to leave the results open the whole time. I can have a whole \"stack\" of completely different search results in different tabs. <br/><br/>2. The Git support in PyCharm is far more complete and advanced. The rebase flow is incredibly well done, especially when dealing with conflicts. <br/><br/>3. When I went to go rename a variable in Python in VS Code, it complained that I hadn't installed rope. It's well known that rope isn't nearly as good as what PyCharm has built in. My point is that VS Code works really well for TypeScript and JavaScript, but I think IntelliJ's \"infrastructure\" makes it better for a whole range of languages. An extension written by a third-party developer is no match for something done very well by the company itself at a foundational level. I'll admit that the guy who wrote the Python extension for VS Code just got hired by Microsoft, which is good, but I think my point still stands. <br/><br/>These arguments in favor of VS Code are not very persuasive to me: <br/><br/>1. I don't really care that it starts fast. So does Vi. I rarely restart PyCharm, so waiting, let's say, 15 seconds once a week or so is irrelevant when I consider all the time it saves me throughout the day. <br/><br/>2. I don't get excited by VS Code's themes. One good light theme and one good dark theme is really all that matters to me. Anything more is an invitation to yak shave :-P <br/><br/>3. I don't buy the fact that VS Code is an \"editor with a few features from an IDE\". It's an IDE. It has an editor, an integrated shell, integrated version control, an integrated debugger, integrated linting, etc. Calling it anything other than an IDE just doesn't make sense to me. Nor does saying that it's lightweight make sense since it's based on Electron which is itself based on millions of lines of C++. <br/><br/>4. Saying that it can do a lot of the things PyCharm does doesn't convince me that it's better than PyCharm. <br/><br/>5. It's a little frustrating to me that people are prejudiced against PyCharm because it's written in Java. VS Code runs on top of Electron (i.e. a browser engine). Java and JavaScript are both based on VMs written in C++. And here's the kicker: they were both written by a lot of the same people. V8 was written by a bunch of ex-Sun people working at Google :-P <br/><br/>At the end of the day, after very careful consideration, the only irrefutable arguments in favor of VS Code, in my mind, compared to PyCharm, WebStorm, IntelliJ, etc. are that: <br/><br/>1. It's free and open source. <br/><br/>2. It's hot right now. <br/><br/>So here are my thoughts: <br/><br/>1. Don't be afraid to learn new things. Don't let prejudices like \"it's an IDE\", \"it's written in Java\", \"it's written by Microsoft\", or \"it'll take longer than an hour to learn it\" hold you back. <br/><br/>2. If you work with a large team, there may be a benefit to using what other people around you are using, especially if they've set it up really nicely and committed the configuration to the repo. <br/><br/>3. In general, for very large codebases that you're getting paid to work on, there are a lot of benefits to using WebStorm, PyCharm, IntelliJ, etc. If you spend a fair amount of time doing very large refactors, the cost of PyCharm in terms of learning curve and money will be more than justified. <br/><br/>4. If you just want something to use for a small project or you want people at a workshop you're teaching to have something sensible, VS Code makes a lot of sense. <br/>"},"userId":"56d7cc3fccee17506699e735","feedId":"5727cd966aaccfa63665b98b","postId":"5a42bd0510906305c8001583","updatedAt":"2017-12-26T21:33:38.563475287Z","title":"JJinuxLand","subscriptionId":"5727cd976aaccfa63665b9a3","tags":["programming"]},{"read":true,"_id":"5a42ad2410906305c800152e-57e9fb18d5ec56510904cac2","createdAt":"2017-12-26T20:12:20.247679331Z","post":{"createdAt":"2017-12-26T20:12:20.214Z","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/7m9yyb/search_files_of_parent_directories_in_fzf/","date":"2017-12-26T20:06:46.000Z","guid":"t3_7m9yyb","author":"/u/racoonear","updatedAt":"2017-12-26T20:12:20.214Z","title":"Search files of parent directories in fzf","description":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Is it possible to search files in parent dirs using fzf?</p><p>It seems that the path displayed in quickfix window is fixed at <code>pwd</code> and I can't change to parent directories. </p><p>Curious how to you handle this kind of situation?</p></div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/racoonear\"> /u/racoonear </a><br/><span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/7m9yyb/search_files_of_parent_directories_in_fzf/\">[link]</a></span><span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/7m9yyb/search_files_of_parent_directories_in_fzf/\">[comments]</a></span>"},"userId":"56d7cc3fccee17506699e735","feedId":"57e9fb17d5ec56510904caa7","postId":"5a42ad2410906305c800152e","updatedAt":"2017-12-26T21:35:08.323098706Z","title":"vim reddit","subscriptionId":"57e9fb18d5ec56510904cac2","tags":["editor","vim","reddit"]},{"read":true,"_id":"5a42ac3910906305c80014f3-56dafff0fa51ced05cd8ddda","createdAt":"2017-12-26T20:08:25.184224203Z","post":{"summary":"Happy holidays to all of my wonderful followers!

Or, you know, we can talk about the latest Star Wars movie or whatever.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not going to put too many limits on it other than A) keep the language professional, since kids starting out in web design might join in; and B) treat everyone in the chat with respect.\r\n</p><p>\r\nMy guess is any given stream session will be two hours, tops.&nbsp; My <strong>tentative</strong> schedule is:\r\n</p><ol><li>December 26th (today!) starting around 2000 UTC (3:00pm EST, 12:00n PST)</li><li>December 27th, 1830 UTC (1:30pm EST, 10:30am PST)</li><li>December 28th, <del datetime=\"2017-12-26T19:20:51+00:00\">1900 UTC (2:00pm EST, 11:00am PST)</del><ins datetime=\"2017-12-26T19:20:51+00:00\">1500 UTC (10:00am EST, 7:00am PST)</ins></li><li>December 29th, 1500 UTC (10:00am EST, 7:00am PST)</li></ol><p>\r\nI don&rsquo;t have a specific structure for how I&rsquo;m going to approach this, other than: first I turn off all site-wide styling and put up a note about it, maybe add a few very minimal styles, rework the page structures to be sane without CSS, then start building up a new design.&nbsp; I have no idea how long each part of that sequence will take (except the &ldquo;remove site-wide styles&rdquo; part, that&rsquo;ll take a few seconds).&nbsp; But there isn&rsquo;t a scheduled &ldquo;Typography Day&rdquo; or what-have-you: I&rsquo;ll probably go wandering off on tangents, riffing on happy accidents, fiddling with stuff as I notice it and it bugs me, etc., etc.&nbsp; In other words, how I normally work.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIf any of this sounds interesting to you, please join in!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll do my best to announce start times with an hour or so lead over on Twitter, and as comments on this post.</p>"},"userId":"56d7cc3fccee17506699e735","feedId":"56d7df82c788cb1d6eb9272e","postId":"5a42aba110906305c80014ee","updatedAt":"2017-12-26T20:05:53.528535073Z","title":"Tech – Thoughts From Eric","subscriptionId":"56d7df82c788cb1d6eb9273e","tags":[]},{"read":false,"_id":"5a42ad3010906305c800152f-5814322a09a64c359672dc38","createdAt":"2017-12-26T20:12:32.20927663Z","post":{"createdAt":"2017-12-26T20:12:32.189Z","inlineStatus":{"readStatusError":null,"readStatus":"success"},"link":"https://m.signalvnoise.com/opening-the-rework-mailbag-part-2-1e3f0252e4e3?source=rss----668e14b18fb1---4","date":"2017-12-26T19:14:03.000Z","guid":"https://medium.com/p/1e3f0252e4e3","author":"Wailin Wong","updatedAt":"2017-12-26T20:12:32.189Z","title":"Opening the Rework Mailbag, Part 2","description":"<div class=\"postArticle-content js-postField js-notesSource js-trackedPost\" data-post-id=\"1e3f0252e4e3\" data-source=\"post_page\" data-collection-id=\"668e14b18fb1\" data-tracking-context=\"postPage\"><section name=\"272c\" class=\"section section--body section--first section--last\"><div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"/></div><div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><figure name=\"f625\" id=\"f625\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf--leading\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.99999999999999%;\"></div><div class=\"iframeContainer\"></div></div></figure><h1 name=\"b8e4\" id=\"b8e4\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure graf--title\">Opening the Rework Mailbag, Part&nbsp;2</h1><p name=\"dab6\" id=\"dab6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">In the second part of our Mailbag episode (check out the first part <a href=\"https://rework.fm/mailbag-1-1/\" data-href=\"https://rework.fm/mailbag-1-1/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>), <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jasonfried\" data-href=\"https://medium.com/@jasonfried\" data-anchor-type=\"2\" data-user-id=\"c030228809f2\" data-action-value=\"c030228809f2\" data-action=\"show-user-card\" data-action-type=\"hover\" class=\"markup--user markup--p-user\" target=\"_blank\">Jason Fried</a> and <a href=\"https://medium.com/@dhh\" data-href=\"https://medium.com/@dhh\" data-anchor-type=\"2\" data-user-id=\"54bcbf647830\" data-action-value=\"54bcbf647830\" data-action=\"show-user-card\" data-action-type=\"hover\" class=\"markup--user markup--p-user\" target=\"_blank\">DHH</a> answer your questions about how non-managers can get support for Rework ideas within their companies;

So, writing or importing modules into an existing or a new web application is almost inevitable. To make the workflow as seamless as possible we also make use of bundlers to compile file assets. &nbsp;</p><p><img data-src=\"https://cdn.scotch.io/13730/14UE0n0RZ65wSqaLpBUb_parcel-log.png\" alt=\"\"/><img/></p><p>Despite having numerous bundlers that carry out practically the same functionality but different and separate modes of configuration, I will like to present to you in this article, a new JavaScript bundler called <a href=\"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/scotch_io/~https://parceljs.org/\">Parcel</a>.</p><h2>What is Parcel and Why Use It?</h2><p>Parcel is an asset bundler for modern applications. It offers a blazing fast compilation time and zero configuration. Simply put, parcel allows simplicity in compiling file assets. Out of the box, parcel can be used on a large code base or just a very basic application that requires compilation of file assets. &nbsp;</p><p>According to the creator of Parcel, the intention was to solve two main problems with existing popular module bundlers like Browserify and Webpack: <strong>performance</strong> and <strong>hassles during configuration</strong>. With Parcel you can easily load modules with either commonJS and ES6 module syntax, as we will see later in this article.</p><p>With Over 12,000 stars already on Github. Parcel has surely gained a lot of attention from the community.</p><p>Some of the features include:</p><ul><li>Blazing fast bundling</li><li>Out of the box support for css, js, HTML, images, file assets and no need to install plugins to carry out all this</li><li>A built in development server.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Benchmark by Parcel</h3><p><img data-src=\"https://cdn.scotch.io/13730/67iS37uT3unKaBhwMiuL_image_preview.png\" alt=\"\"/><img/></p><h2>What we will learn</h2><p>In this article, I am going to show you how to set up parcel, how to create modules and how to use it with existing npm modules, sass and some other stuffs with very minimal or no configuration at all.\r\nReady? let&rsquo;s get to work!</p><h2>Getting Started</h2><p>Getting started and setting up Parcel is incredibly simple. Install Parcel globally on your machine with:&nbsp;</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npm install -g parcel-bundler</code></pre><p>If you are on unix, you might need to do this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">sudo npm install -g parcel-bundler</code></pre><p>Create a directory and intialize by creating a <code>package.json</code> file in the newly created project directory:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">mkdir parcel-project</code></pre><p>Now change directory and initialize a node project:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">cd parcel-project&nbsp;\r\nnpm init -y</code></pre><p>This will create a <code>package.json</code> with default settings within the project directory.</p><h2>Set Up Entry Point</h2><p>Parcel accepts files like HTML and JavaScript as an entry point. Create these files :</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">touch index.html &amp;&amp; touch index.js</code></pre><p>Add the relative path to your JavaScript file in the <code>index.html</code>.</p><pre><code class=\"language-html\">    &lt;!DOCTYPE html>\r\n    &lt;html lang=\"en\">\r\n    &lt;head>\r\n        &lt;meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\r\n        &lt;meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\r\n        &lt;meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"ie=edge\">\r\n        &lt;title>Parcel Project&lt;/title>\r\n    &lt;/head>\r\n    &lt;body>\r\n        &lt;h2 id=\"content\">&lt;/h2>\r\n        &lt;script src=\"./index.js\">&lt;/script>\r\n    &lt;/body>\r\n    &lt;/html></code></pre><p>Now open <code>Index.js</code> and write:</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">    console.log(\"This is just a test\");</code></pre><h2>Start Server</h2><p>Update <code>package.json</code>  file with a script to run parcel built in server.</p><pre><code class=\"language-json\">{\r\n...\r\n  \"scripts\": {\r\n    \"start\": \"parcel index.html\"\r\n  },\r\n ...\r\n}</code></pre><p>Start the server :</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npm run start</code></pre><p><img data-src=\"https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_40D14D86A2BF3EC77B50DB4E222C29503F83F1159982892681E9B7F10A814ECF_1513942166430_server.gif\" alt=\"\"/><img/></p><p><img data-src=\"https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_40D14D86A2BF3EC77B50DB4E222C29503F83F1159982892681E9B7F10A814ECF_1513942896513_Screen+Shot+2017-12-22+at+12.41.08+PM.png\" alt=\"\"/><img/></p><p>Apart from starting a local server on port 1234, Parcel will automatically create a <code>dist</code> folder</p><p><img data-src=\"https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_40D14D86A2BF3EC77B50DB4E222C29503F83F1159982892681E9B7F10A814ECF_1513943596108_Screen+Shot+2017-12-22+at+12.44.24+PM.png\" alt=\"\"/><img/></p><p>Within the new <code>dist``'</code> folder created, the new js file <code>parcel-project.js``'</code> contains the compiled code by parcel and also included is a new index.html file.</p><h2>Code Splitting</h2><p>To better demonstrate some other features of Parcel, lets import modules from a different files. Parcel supports both CommonJs and Es6 module syntax for importing files.</p><h2>CommonJS Syntax</h2><p>Create a new file:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">touch data.js</code></pre><p>Fill it with: </p><pre><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">// ./data.js \r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n    name: \"Olususi Oluyemi\",\r\n    designation: \"Software Developer\",\r\n    hobby: \"Writing\"\r\n}</code></pre><p>Next, require this module and access properties within it from <code>index.js</code> file:</p><pre><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">// ./index.js\r\nconst details = require('./data');\r\nvar content = \"My name is \" + details.name + \".\" + \" I am a \" + details.designation + \" and I love \" + details.hobby;\r\ndocument.getElementById('content').innerHTML = content;</code></pre><p>Here we required the module and write the content within it into the DOM. </p><p><img data-src=\"https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_40D14D86A2BF3EC77B50DB4E222C29503F83F1159982892681E9B7F10A814ECF_1513948308307_Screen+Shot+2017-12-22+at+2.10.20+PM.png\" alt=\"\"/><img/></p><h2>Es6 Module Syntax</h2><p>Lets do the same by using Es6 Module syntax. Change the content within <code>./data.js</code> to :</p><pre><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">export const details = {\r\n    name: \"Olususi Oluyemi\",\r\n    designation: \"Software Developer\",\r\n    hobby: \"Writing\" \r\n}</code></pre><p>In order to avoid undefined properties, change the mode of importing modules within <code>index.js</code> so that it can conform with Es6 Syntax.</p><pre><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">\r\n    // ./index.js\r\n    import { details } from './data';\r\n    var content = \"My name is \" + details.name + \".\" + \" I am a \" + details.designation + \" and I love \" + details.hobby;\r\n    document.getElementById('content').innerHTML = content;</code></pre><p>The result should still be the same.</p><h2>Hot Module Replacement</h2><p>For improved development experience, Parcel&rsquo;s hot module reloading implementation automatically updates modules in the browser without the need to refresh the page. This support is for both JavaScript and CSS assets. Lets try this out. Change the contents within <code>./data.js</code> and see the live update immediately your files are been saved :</p><p><img data-src=\"https://cdn.scotch.io/13730/rjeDx8RtT96V3L3XIcWA_hmr.gif\" alt=\"\"/><img/></p><h2>Transform</h2><p>Another awesome feature of Parcel is the support for common transforms and transpilers like Babel, PostCSS and PostHTML. Babel can be used to transform JavaScript, PostCSS for CSS and PostHTML for HTML. Each one of these transpilers has a unique configuration file and once Parcel finds anyone of the config files, it will automatically run these transforms.</p><h2>Working with Sass</h2><p>To work with Sass we will need to install <code>node-sass</code> package:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npm install node-sass</code></pre><p>Now create a sass file</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">    touch style.scss</code></pre><p>Add some styling and import  <code>style.scss</code> to <code>index.js</code>:</p><pre><code class=\"language-css\">// ./style.scss\r\nbody  {\r\n    color: red;\r\n    padding-right: 1rem;\r\n}</code></pre><p>Don&rsquo;t forget to import the style.css within index.js</p><pre><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">// .index.js\r\nimport './style.scss';\r\n// ...\r\n</code></pre><p><img data-src=\"https://cdn.scotch.io/13730/KeFiyxmqSjy0zSBM0b3M_Screen%20Shot%202017-12-23%20at%2012.19.45%20AM.png\" alt=\"\"/><img/></p><h2>Final Thought</h2><p>Parcel is still very new and certainly will have more features added by the creator subsequently. There is no better bundler than another, I strongly believe in choosing the right tool for the job. But if you love simplicity and ease of set up, you definitely want to try parcel.&nbsp;</p><p>As we have learnt from this article, setting up parcel is very simple and the support for all kind of files and other mind blowing features is incredibly encouraging. Feel free to try this out in your new or existing project.

Information about the health and performance of your deployments not only helps your team react to issues, it also gives them the security to make changes with confidence.  One of the best ways to gain this insight is with a robust monitoring system that gathers metrics, visualizes data, and alerts operators when things appear to be broken.</p><p>In our <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-metrics-monitoring-and-alerting\">introduction to metrics, monitoring, and alerting guide</a>, we discussed some of the core concepts involved in monitoring software and infrastructure.  Metrics are the primary material processed by monitoring systems to build a cohesive view of the systems being tracked.  Knowing which components are worth monitoring and what specific characteristics you should be looking at is the first step in designing a system that can provide reliable, actionable insights about the state of your software and hardware.</p><p>In this guide, we will start by discussing a popular framework used to identify the most critical metrics to track.  Afterwards, we will walk through how those indicators can be applied to components throughout your deployment.  This process will focus on the fundamental resources of individual servers at first and then adjust the scope to cover increasingly larger areas of concern.</p><h2 id=\"the-golden-signals-of-monitoring\">The Golden Signals of Monitoring</h2><p>In the highly influential <a href=\"https://landing.google.com/sre/book.html\">Google SRE (site reliability engineering) Book</a>, the chapter on monitoring distributed systems introduces a useful framework called the <strong>four golden signals of monitoring</strong> that represents the most important factors to measure in a user-facing system.  We will discuss each of these four characteristics below.</p><h3 id=\"latency\">Latency</h3><p>Latency is a measurement of the time it takes to complete an action.  The specifics of how this is measured depends on the component, but some common analogues are processing time, response time, or travel time.</p><p>Measuring latency gives you a concrete measure of how long a specific task or action takes to complete.  Capturing the latency of various components allows you to build a holistic model of the different performance characteristics of your system.  This can help you find bottlenecks, understand which resources require the most time to access, and notice when actions suddenly take longer than expected.  The authors of the SRE book emphasize the importance of distinguishing between successful and unsuccessful requests when calculating latencies, as they can have very different profiles that might skew the averages of a service.</p><h3 id=\"traffic\">Traffic</h3><p>Traffic measures the \"busyness\" of your components and systems.  This captures the load or demand on your services so that you can understand how much work your system is currently performing.</p><p>Sustained high or low traffic numbers can indicate that the service might need more resources or that a problem is preventing traffic from being routed correctly.  However, for the majority of cases, traffic rates will be most useful in helping understand issues surfaced through other signals.  For example, if latency increases beyond an acceptable level, being able to correlate that time frame with a spike in traffic is helpful.  Traffic can be used to understand the maximum amount of traffic that can be handled and how the service degrades or fails at various stages of load.</p><h3 id=\"errors\">Errors</h3><p>It is important to track errors to understand the health of your components and how frequently they are failing to respond to requests appropriately.  Some applications or services expose errors in clean, ready-made interfaces, but additional work may be required to gather the data from other programs.</p><p>Distinguishing between different types of errors can make it easier to pinpoint the exact nature of problems that are impacting your applications.  This also gives you flexibility in alerting.  You might need to be alerted immediately if one type of error appears, but for another, you might not be concerned as long as the rate is below an acceptable threshold.</p><h3 id=\"saturation\">Saturation</h3><p>Saturation measures how much of a given resource is being used.  Percentages or fractions are frequently used with resources that have a clear total capacity, but more creative measurements might be needed for resources with less well-defined maximum.</p><p>Saturation data provides information about the resources that a service or application depends on to operate effectively.  Since a service provided by one component may be consumed by another, saturation is one of the glue metrics that surfaces the capacity problems of underlying systems.  As such, saturation and latency problems in one layer might correspond with a marked increase in traffic or error measurements in the underlying layer.</p><h2 id=\"measuring-important-data-throughout-your-environment\">Measuring Important Data Throughout Your Environment</h2><p>Using the four golden signals as a guideline, you can begin to look at how those metrics would be expressed throughout the hierarchy of your systems.  Since services are often built by adding layers of abstraction on top of more basic components, metrics should be designed to add insight at each level of the deployment.</p><p>We will look at different levels of complexity present in common distributed application environments:</p><ul><li>Individual server components</li><li>Applications and services</li><li>Collections of servers</li><li>Environmental dependencies</li><li>End-to-end experience</li></ul><p>The ordering above expands the scope and level of abstraction with each subsequent layer.</p><h2 id=\"metrics-to-collect-for-individual-server-components\">Metrics to Collect for Individual Server Components</h2><p>The base level metrics that are important to collect are those relevant to the underlying computers that your systems rely on.  Although considerable effort in modern software development goes into abstracting the physical components and low level operating system details, every service relies on the underlying hardware and operating systems to do its work.  Because of this, keeping an eye on the foundational resources of your machines is the first step in building an understanding of the health of your systems.</p><p>When considering which metrics to collect at the machine level, think about the individual resources available.  These will include representations of your server's hardware as well as core abstractions provided by the OS, like processes and file descriptors.  Looking at each component in terms of the four golden signals, certain signals may be obvious while others may be more difficult to reason about.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.brendangregg.com\">Brendan Gregg</a>, an influential performance engineer, outlines many ways to get core metrics from Linux systems to satisfy the needs of a framework he calls the <a href=\"http://www.brendangregg.com/usemethod.html\">USE method for performance analysis</a> (<strong>u</strong>tilization, <strong>s</strong>aturation, and <strong>e</strong>rrors).  Since there is significant overlap between the USE method and the four golden signals, we can use some of his recommendations as a jumping off point for figuring out what data to collect from server components.</p><p>To measure <strong>CPU</strong>, the following measurements might be appropriate:</p><ul><li><strong>Latency</strong>: Average or maximum delay in CPU scheduler</li><li><strong>Traffic</strong>: CPU utilization</li><li><strong>Errors</strong>: Processor specific error events, faulted CPUs</li><li><strong>Saturation</strong>: Run queue length</li></ul><p>For <strong>memory</strong>, the signals might look like this:</p><ul><li><strong>Latency</strong>: (none - difficult to find a good method of measuring and not actionable)</li><li><strong>Traffic</strong>: Amount of memory being used</li><li><strong>Errors</strong>: Out of memory errors</li><li><strong>Saturation</strong>: OOM killer events, swap usage</li></ul><p>For <strong>storage devices</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Latency</strong>: average wait time (<code>await</code>) for reads and writes</li><li><strong>Traffic</strong>: read and write I/O levels</li><li><strong>Errors</strong>: filesystem errors, disk errors in <code>/sys/devices</code></li><li><strong>Saturation</strong>: I/O queue depth</li></ul><p>The <strong>networking</strong> signals can look like this:</p><ul><li><strong>Latency</strong>: Network driver queue</li><li><strong>Traffic</strong>: Incoming and outgoing bytes or packets per second</li><li><strong>Errors</strong>: Network device errors, dropped packets</li><li><strong>Saturation</strong>: overruns, dropped packets, retransmitted segments</li></ul><p>Along with representations of physical resources, it is also a good idea to gather metrics related to operating system abstractions that have limits enforced.  Some examples that fall into this category are file handles and thread counts.  These are not physical resources, but instead constructs with ceilings set by the operating system to prevent processes from overextending themselves.  Most can be adjusted and configured with commands like <code>ulimit</code>, but tracking changes in usage of these resources can help you detect potentially harmful changes in your software's usage.</p><h2 id=\"metrics-to-collect-for-applications-and-services\">Metrics to Collect for Applications and Services</h2><p>Moving up a layer, we start to deal with the applications and services that run on the servers.  These programs use the individual server components we dealt with earlier as resources to do work.  Metrics at this level help us understand the health of our single-host applications and services.  We've separated distributed, multi-host services into a separate section to clarify the factors most important in those configurations.</p><p>While the metrics in the last section detailed the capabilities and performance of individual components and the operating system, the metrics here will tell us how well applications are able to perform the work we ask of them.  We also want to know what resources our applications depend on and how well they manage those constraints.</p><p>It is important to keep in mind that the metrics in this section represent a departure from the generalized approach we were able to use last time.  The metrics that are most important from this point on will be very dependent on your applications' characteristics, your configuration, and the workloads that you are running on your machines.  We can discuss ways of identifying your most important metrics, but your results will depend on what the server is specifically being asked to do.</p><p>For applications that serve clients, the four golden signals are often fairly straightforward to pick out:</p><ul><li><strong>Latency</strong>: The time to complete requests</li><li><strong>Traffic</strong>: Number of requests per second served</li><li><strong>Errors</strong>: Application errors that occur when processing client requests or accessing resources</li><li><strong>Saturation</strong>: The percentage or amount of resources currently being used</li></ul><p>Some of the more important metrics you'll want to keep track of are those related to dependencies.  These will often be best expressed by saturation metrics related to individual components.  For instance, application memory utilization, available connections, number of file handles opened, or number of workers active can help you understand the effect of your configuration applied in the context of the physical server.</p><p>The four golden signals were designed primarily for distributed microservices, so they assume a client-server architecture.  For applications that do not use a client-server architecture, the same signals are still important, but the \"traffic\" signal might need to be reconsidered slightly.  This is basically a measurement of busyness, so finding a metric that adequately represents that for your application will serve the same purpose.  The specifics will depend on what your program is doing, but some general substitutes might be the number of operations or data processed per second.</p><h2 id=\"metrics-to-measure-collections-of-servers-and-their-communication\">Metrics to Measure Collections of Servers and Their Communication</h2><p>Most services, especially when operated in a production environment, will span multiple server instances to increase performance and availability.  This increased level of complexity adds additional surface area that is important to monitor.  Distributed computing and redundant systems can make your systems more flexible, but network-based coordination is more fragile than communication within a single host.  Robust monitoring can help alleviate some of the difficulties of dealing with a less reliable communication channel.</p><p>Beyond the network itself, for distributed services, the health and performance of the server group is more important than the same measures applied to any individual host.  While services are intimately tied to the computer they run on when confined to a single host, redundant multi-host services rely on the resources of multiple hosts while remaining decoupled from direct dependency on any one computer.</p><p>The golden signals at this level look very similar to those measuring service health in the last section.  They will, however, take into account the additional coordination required between group members:</p><ul><li><strong>Latency</strong>: Time for the pool to respond to requests, time to coordinate or synchronize with peers</li><li><strong>Traffic</strong>: Number of requests processed by the pool per second</li><li><strong>Errors</strong>: Application errors that occur when processing client requests, accessing resources, or reaching peers</li><li><strong>Saturation</strong>: The amount of resources currently being used, the number of servers currently operating at capacity, the number of servers available.</li></ul><p>While these have a definite resemblance to the important metrics for single-host services, each of the signals grows in complexity when distributed.  Latency becomes a more complicated issue as processing can require communication between multiple hosts.  Traffic is no longer a function of a single server's abilities, but is instead a summary of the groups capabilities and the efficiency of the routing algorithm used to distribute work.  Additional error modes are introduced related to networking connectivity or host failure.  Finally, saturation expands to include the combined resources available to the hosts, the networking link connecting each host, and the ability to properly coordinate access to the dependencies each computer needs.</p><h2 id=\"metrics-related-to-external-dependencies-and-the-deployment-environment\">Metrics Related to External Dependencies and the Deployment Environment</h2><p>Some of the most valuable metrics to collect exist at the boundary of your application or service, outside of your direct control.  External dependencies including those related to your hosting provider and any services your applications are built to rely on.  These represent resources you are not able to administer directly, but which can compromise your ability to guarantee your own service.</p><p>Because external dependencies represent critical resources, one of the only mitigation strategies available in case of full outages is to switch operations to a different provider.  This is only a viable strategy for commodity services, and even then only with prior planning and loose coupling with the provider.  Even when mitigation is difficult, knowledge of external events affecting your application is incredibly valuable.</p><p>The golden signals applied to external dependencies may look similar to this:</p><ul><li><strong>Latency</strong>: Time it takes to receive a response from the service or to provision new resources from a provider</li><li><strong>Traffic</strong>: Amount of work being pushed to an external service, the number of requests being made to an external API</li><li><strong>Errors</strong>: Error rates for service requests</li><li><strong>Saturation</strong>: Amount of account-restricted resources used (instances, API requests, acceptable cost, etc.)</li></ul><p>These metrics can help you identify problems with your dependencies, alert you to impending resource exhaustion, and help keep expenses under control.  If the service has drop-in alternatives, this data can be used to decide whether to move work to a different provider when metrics indicate a problem is occurring.  For situations with less flexibility, the metrics can at least be used to alert an operator to respond to the situation and implement any available manual mitigation options.</p><h2 id=\"metrics-that-track-overall-functionality-and-end-to-end-experience\">Metrics that Track Overall Functionality and End-to-End Experience</h2><p>The highest level metrics track requests through the system in context of the outermost component that users interact with.  This might be a load balancer or other routing mechanism that is responsible for receiving and coordinating requests to your service.  Since this represents the first touch point with your system, collecting metrics at this level gives an approximation of the overall user experience.</p><p>While the previously described metrics are incredibly useful, the metrics in this section are often the most important to set up alerting for.  To avoid response fatigue, alerts&mdash;especially pages&mdash;should be reserved for scenarios that have a recognizable negative effect on user experience.  Problems surfaced with these metrics can be investigated by drilling down using the metrics collected at other levels.</p><p>The signals we look for here are similar to those of the individual services we described earlier.  The primary difference is the scope and the importance of the data we gather here:</p><ul><li><strong>Latency</strong>: The time to complete user requests </li><li><strong>Traffic</strong>: Number of user requests per second</li><li><strong>Errors</strong>: Errors that occur when processing client requests or accessing resources</li><li><strong>Saturation</strong>: The percentage or amount of resources currently being used</li></ul><p>As these metrics parallel user requests, values that fall outside of acceptable ranges for these metrics likely indicate direct user impact.  Latency that does not conform to customer-facing or internal SLAs (service level agreements), traffic that indicates a severe spike or drop off, increases in errors rates, and an inability to serve requests due to resource constraints are all fairly straightforward to reason about at this level.  Assuming that the metrics are accurate, the values here can be directly mapped against your availability, performance, and reliability goals.</p><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>In this guide, we began by discussing the four golden signals that tend to be most helpful for discovering and understanding impactful changes in your systems.  Afterwards, we used the signals as a lens to evaluate the most important factors to track at different layers of a deployment.</p><p>Evaluating your systems from from top to bottom can help identify the critical components and interactions required to run reliable and performant services.  The four golden signals can be a great starting point for structuring metrics to best indicate the health of your systems.  However, keep in mind that while the golden signals are a good framework, you will have to be aware of other metrics specific to your situation.  Collect whatever data you think will be most likely to warn of problems or help you troubleshoot when things go wrong.</p>"},"userId":"56d7cc3fccee17506699e735","feedId":"56d7e166c788cb1d6eb9358e","postId":"5a426b4810906305c80013b9","updatedAt":"2017-12-26T15:31:20.344423429Z","title":"DigitalOcean Community Tutorials","subscriptionId":"56d7e167c788cb1d6eb935f3","tags":["technology","tutorials","linux"]},{"read":false,"_id":"5a426c5a10906305c80013cb-57e9f803d5ec56510904c9f4","createdAt":"2017-12-26T15:35:54.390028487Z","post":{"createdAt":"2017-12-26T15:35:54.367Z","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/7m8907/what_is_the_preferred_build_system_for_projects/","date":"2017-12-26T15:14:36.000Z","guid":"t3_7m8907","author":"/u/Sh4pe_","updatedAt":"2017-12-26T15:35:54.367Z","title":"What is the preferred build system for projects using GHC 8.2? Cabal, or stack, or something else?","description":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><h3>tl;dr</h3><p>Does <code>stack</code> have problems when you want to use it with GHC 8.2 and would you therefore rather use <code>cabal</code>? Or even something else?</p><h3>Some context</h3><p>I recently upgraded a project of mine that was build with <code>stack</code> to GHC 8.2.2. I was really looking forward to this, especially since the first <a href=\"https://www.stackage.org\">stackage</a> LTS release that supported the new GHC took quite a while.</p><p>But after updating to LTS 10.0, I ran into problems. It appears that my IDE depends on <a href=\"https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ghc-mod\">ghc-mod</a> (I use IntelliJ with <a href=\"https://github.com/rikvdkleij/intellij-haskell/\">intellij-haskell</a>, which in turn requires <code>ghc-mod</code>). However, <code>ghc-mod</code> seems to have problems when compiled with GHC 8.2 as of now (which has something to do with it's feature <em>backpack</em>, see <a href=\"https://github.com/DanielG/ghc-mod/issues/900#issuecomment-335448771\">this comment</a> in a GitHub pull request). Also, I've read that the GHC folks use Cabal themselves.</p><p>So I was wondering if you would encourage using <code>cabal</code> over <code>stack</code>. Or even something else? And are there drawbacks in <code>cabal</code> over <code>stack</code>? E.g., I've read about <code>cabal</code>'s \"dependency hell\" <a href=\"https://wiki.haskell.org/Cabal/Survival\">here</a> but never experienced it myself. I could really need some experienced advice and/or opinions.</p></div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Sh4pe_\"> /u/Sh4pe_ </a><br/><span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/7m8907/what_is_the_preferred_build_system_for_projects/\">[link]</a></span><span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/7m8907/what_is_the_preferred_build_system_for_projects/\">[comments]</a></span>"},"userId":"56d7cc3fccee17506699e735","feedId":"57e9f802d5ec56510904c9d9","postId":"5a426c5a10906305c80013cb","updatedAt":"2017-12-26T15:35:54.390026327Z","title":"Haskell  Reddit","subscriptionId":"57e9f803d5ec56510904c9f4","tags":["haskell","reddit"]},{"read":false,"_id":"5a428cd710906305c800147e-5814f2d909a64c359672dded","createdAt":"2017-12-26T17:54:31.203211498Z","post":{"summary":"<div id=\"outline-container-org80491be\" class=\"outline-2\">\n<h2 id=\"org80491be\"></h2>\n<div class=\"outline-text-2\" id=\"text-org80491be\">\n<p>\nI usually don't do year in review posts.

And 'tis the season for yearly reviews, so...<br/><br/>It's been pretty wild. So many times I thought \"this stuff really deserves a bloggin\", but then it was too inviting to grab onto the next thing and get that rolling.<br/><br/>Instead of taking a deep dive into some topic already, I want to scan through that year in review and think for myself, what were the big things, the important things, the things I achieved, and the things I learned. And then later on, if I ever get around to it, grab one of these topics and elaborate in a dedicated blog-post. Like a bucket-list of the blog posts that I should have written. Here goes:<br/><h3>How given no other structures, silos will grow by themselves</h3>This was my initial shock after joining the company. Only a few years after taking off as a startup, the hedges began growing, seemingly almost by themselves, and against the will of the founders. I've worked in silos, and in companies without them, but I haven't been there to witness them coming into existence before. It is a fascinating phenomenon, yet oh, so common. And a killer of great companies.<br/><h3>When you got no other reason for improving, go for lead time</h3>There are so many reasons for why you would want to drive organizational change, stop the silofication, bring in some agile values, and so on. But the one reason that rings true and clear for any person in the company is&nbsp;<i>lead time</i>. Then you can slowly start to talk about the cost of WIP, hand-offs, and so on.&nbsp;&nbsp;When explaining the why, start with lead time.<br/><h3>The best patterns for introducing organizational change in are inscrutable</h3>I tried out several patterns, from early adopters, to whispering in the general's ear. I tried driving changes by committee and without. We tried bootstrapping, and we tried organic change. It always felt like a mix of hurt and help, but it seems through any of the changes, they were for the better (unless they are driven by targets, of course). The only way to know for sure whether I had the right strategy is to go back in time and compare how the options would work out in alternative realities. So we're left with, once again, gut feelings.<br/><h3>Developing the ubiquitous language of organizational change</h3>In a company where the norm is to shun any hype, and avoiding cargo-culting by all means, it was not easy to use the language I had come to learn in the industry. Mentioning Agile would derail any discussion into shoot-downs, anecdotes and personal opinions and experiences. Few of the agile values, principles or practices were taken at face value. The more experienced colleagues had bad experiences with \"agile transformations\", and the large majority of younger colleagues (funny, cause I feel like I've always been the youngest where ever I worked, and suddenly here I'm in the oldest 15 percentile) have not suffered the pains of silofication, nor experienced the joy of successful organizational change.<br/><br/>As is the norm these days, \"DevOps\" has already been reduced to infrastructure engineering. Scrum is a fad, Kanban is a board on the wall, XP is some long gone neck-beard hippie thing. Sprints are pointless. Conway's law is unknown, as is Lean. Rationality, skepticism and pragmatism rules. Which can be good, but it can also grind conversations about organizational improvement to zero velocity (pun intended).<br/><br/>So, I started with a survey, \"What should we call the things\". By now, we've basically come up with our own methodology. Hell, it's even one of them \"scaling\" ones. And we use a lot of seemingly boring words to describe very powerful things.<br/><h3>The emerging trend of self-management in organizations is going to be big</h3><div>As eyeo is at the steps of exploiting more agile values and principles, we also look to the horizon to see what is coming. The ideas of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.reinventingorganizationswiki.com/Teal_Organizations\">teal organizations</a>&nbsp;rhyme very well with agile and DevOps, but they go way beyond. Surprisingly (and yet, perhaps not), a lot of these self-organizing principles are easier to apply to eyeo than the agile predecessors. Albeit eyeo is an overgrown start-up of sorts, with the expected chaos, their universal inner values are&nbsp;<b>fairness</b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<b>transparency</b>. Armed with this, a lot of the self-organizing patterns are a great fit.</div><h3>Balancing the act of dropping into Operations, while driving organizational change</h3><div>This is where I failed the hardest. And perhaps where I learned the most. How can I reconcile the act of supporting one particular department, while I at the same time am trying to break them up across cross-functional teams? I went on for too long ignoring this conflict, and it cost a lot of soul to make things right, and there's still a lot to do.</div><h3>Building bridges in a company which is both remote and not</h3><div>I am a hybrid remote worker, which means I am simply not a remote worker (or remotee, as they're called at eyeo). As most remote workers know, a mixed remote/local team is the trickiest constellation to have in any company. It does work at eyeo so far, mostly for historical reasons and remote culture being deep in the DNA of the founders, but it will only get us so far. We can't become co-located, nor does the majority really want to, so we have to improve. I've got some ideas, but haven't gotten so far with this yet.</div><h3>Team autonomy vs company standardization</h3><div>This one's a real classic. How can you pick a company-standard chat tool, while giving teams the autonomy to pick their own? This topic is fairly exhausted in the DevOps literature by now, I guess, so I'm not sure it's worth it. I got a lot of thoughts on it, but they may not be so original. A lot of it comes down to&nbsp;<b>decision making</b>, which in its own right is a big topic.</div><h3>It's like blog post tapas</h3><div>So, those are the ones I had in my head right now. If you got this far, and you'd care to give me a tweet, let me know which one I should write first.</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/tfnico/~4/iIhBKbzHaqs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/><img/>"},"userId":"56d7cc3fccee17506699e735","feedId":"57030b5a019571f8059c7d57","postId":"5a425bcc10906305c800139b","updatedAt":"2017-12-26T14:25:16.769391009Z","title":"Thomas Ferris Nicolaisen's blog","subscriptionId":"57030b5a019571f8059c7d71","tags":["programming"]},{"read":false,"_id":"5a425c1610906305c800139c-57e9f803d5ec56510904c9f4","createdAt":"2017-12-26T14:26:30.086604617Z","post":{"createdAt":"2017-12-26T14:26:30.052Z","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/7m7qqe/humble_book_bundle_be_a_coder_presented_by_no/","date":"2017-12-26T13:24:46.000Z","guid":"t3_7m7qqe","author":"/u/13378","updatedAt":"2017-12-26T14:26:30.052Z","title":"Humble Book Bundle: Be a Coder presented by No Starch Press","description":"  submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/13378\"> /u/13378 </a><br/><span><a href=\"https://www.humblebundle.com/books/be-a-coder-books?partner=indiekings\">[link]</a></span><span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/7m7qqe/humble_book_bundle_be_a_coder_presented_by_no/\">[comments]</a></span>"},"userId":"56d7cc3fccee17506699e735","feedId":"57e9f802d5ec56510904c9d9","postId":"5a425c1610906305c800139c","updatedAt":"2017-12-26T14:26:30.086602537Z","title":"Haskell  Reddit","subscriptionId":"57e9f803d5ec56510904c9f4","tags":["haskell","reddit"]},{"read":false,"_id":"5a424bfc10906305c800136b-57e9faf5d5ec56510904caa6","createdAt":"2017-12-26T13:17:48.836161285Z","post":{"createdAt":"2017-12-26T13:17:48.797Z","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/7m7p0e/orgmode_e07s05_goal_setting_goal_tracking/","date":"2017-12-26T13:12:35.000Z","guid":"t3_7m7p0e","author":"/u/VanLaser","updatedAt":"2017-12-26T13:17:48.797Z","title":"OrgMode E07S05: Goal setting & Goal Tracking","description":"  submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/VanLaser\"> /u/VanLaser </a><br/><span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APhhHCBI8xc&amp;index=35&amp;list=PLVtKhBrRV_ZkPnBtt_TD1Cs9PJlU0IIdE\">[link]</a></span><span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/7m7p0e/orgmode_e07s05_goal_setting_goal_tracking/\">[comments]</a></span>"},"userId":"56d7cc3fccee17506699e735","feedId":"57e9faf5d5ec56510904ca8c","postId":"5a424bfc10906305c800136b","updatedAt":"2017-12-26T13:17:48.836159285Z","title":"emacs reddit","subscriptionId":"57e9faf5d5ec56510904caa6","tags":["editor","emacs","reddit"]},{"read":false,"_id":"5a424c0b10906305c800136c-5814c43709a64c359672dd7a","createdAt":"2017-12-26T13:18:03.748857574Z","post":{"createdAt":"2017-12-26T13:18:03.722Z","inlineStatus":{"readStatusError":null,"readStatus":"success"},"link":"https://medium.freecodecamp.org/using-the-simple-factory-design-pattern-is-a-lot-like-making-cheesecake-92a119cde191?source=rss----336d898217ee---4","date":"2017-12-26T12:47:05.000Z","guid":"https://medium.com/p/92a119cde191","author":"Sihui Huang","updatedAt":"2017-12-26T13:18:03.722Z","title":"Using the Simple Factory design pattern is a lot like making cheesecake","description":"<div class=\"postArticle-content js-postField js-notesSource js-trackedPost\" data-post-id=\"92a119cde191\" data-source=\"post_page\" data-collection-id=\"336d898217ee\" data-tracking-context=\"postPage\"><section name=\"7170\" class=\"section section--body section--first\"><div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"/></div><div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><h1 name=\"4790\" id=\"4790\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf--leading graf--title\">Using the Simple Factory design pattern is a lot like making cheesecake</h1></div><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--fullWidth\"><figure name=\"7142\" id=\"7142\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutFillWidth graf-after--h3\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 66.7%;\"></div><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*JtDoAdFERT4heuYF6gGpyg.png\" data-width=\"6000\" data-height=\"4000\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*JtDoAdFERT4heuYF6gGpyg.png\"/></div></figure></div><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p name=\"ff9d\" id=\"ff9d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Factory Patterns are about encapsulating object creation.</p><p name=\"d0c1\" id=\"d0c1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But before diving into details of the patterns, let&rsquo;s talk about cheesecake.

Initech recruits heavily from their hometown school, the University of Initown. UoI, like most universities, is a hidebound and bureaucratic institution, but in Initown, that’s creating a problem.

Derek, being both technologically savvy and security conscious, was one of the first people to sign up, and he pulled his entire staff along with him. It made sense: they were all young, technologically competent, and had smartphones that could run the school’s 2FA app. He <em>encouraged</em> their other customers to join them, but given that at least three professors didn’t use email and instead had the department secretary print out emails, there were some battles that simply weren’t worth fighting. <!-- I'll be honest, I've generally been a holdout on 2FA. Part of it is because until (relatively) recently, a lot of Internet 2FA systems used text messages, and I generally don't like paying for text messages. Now that there's apps for most of this, I use it more often. I don't mind pressing \"yes\" on my phone once in awhile. Weirdly, the Steam iPhone app gives me my 2FA tokens, but I can't actually log in from the iPhone app. Not that I browse steam from my phone in the first place, it's just weird. --></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three months went by, which is an eyeblink in University Time™. There was no further direction from the Technology Council. Within the Business School, very little happened with 2FA. A few faculty members, especially the ones fresh from the private sector, signed up. Very few tenured professors did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And then Derek received this email:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>To: <em>AllITSManagers<br/>\r\nFrom: ITS-Adminsd@initown.edu<br/>\r\nSubject: Two-Factor Authentication<br/>\r\nEffective two weeks from today, we will be requiring 2FA to be enabled on </em>all* accounts on the network, including student accounts. Please see attached, and communicate the changes to your customers.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Rolling out a change of this scale in two weeks would be a daunting task in any environment. Trying to get University faculty to change <em>anything</em> in a two week period was doomed to fail. Adding <em>students</em> to the mix promised to be a disaster. Derek read the attached “Transition Plan” document, hoping to see a cunning plan to manage the rollout. It was 15 pages of “Two-Factor Authentication(2FA) is more secure, and is an industry best practice,” and “The University President wants to see this change happen”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Derek compiled a list of all of his concerns- it was a long list- and raised it to his boss. His boss shrugged: “Those are the orders”. Derek escalated up through the business school administration, and after two days of frantic emails and, “Has anyone actually thought this through?” Derek was promised 5 minutes at the end of the next Technology Council meeting… which was <em>one</em> week before the deadline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Technology Council met in one of the administrative conference rooms in a recently constructed building named after a rich alumni who paid for the building. The room was shiny and packed with teleconferencing equipment that had never properly been configured, and thus was useless. It also had a top-of-the-line SmartBoard display, which was also in the same unusable state. <!-- So, way back in the day, I served as the student liaison for the technology council at my tiny college. I made the horrible mistake of actually trying to engage with my fellow students, and was kicked off after a few months, and replaced by somebody who just sat in on meetings and nodded along with the administrators and faculty who made real decisions. In retrospect, I may have also just been too much of an asshole about my disagreements. In general, it's a safe bet that I was a giant asshole $X years ago relative to the kind of asshole I am now. --></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Derek was finally acknowledged by the council, he started with his questions. “So, I’ve read through the Transition Plan document,” he said, “but I don’t see anything about how we’re going to on-board new customers to this process. How is everyone going to use it?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“They’ll just use the smartphone app,” the Chair said. “We’re making things more secure by using two-factor.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Right, but over in the Business School, we’ve got a lot of faculty that don’t <em>have</em> smartphones.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Administrator #2, seated to the Chair’s left, chimed in, “They can just receive a text. This is making things more secure.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Okay,” Derek said, “but we’ve still got faculty without cellphones. Or even desk phones. Or even <em>desks</em> for that matter. Adjunct professors don’t <em>get</em> offices, but they still need their email.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was a beat of silence as the Chair and Administrators considered this. Administrator #1 triumphantly pounded the conference table and declared, “They can use a hardware token! This will make our network more secure!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Administrator #2 winced. “Ah… this project doesn’t have a budget for hardware tokens. It’s a capital expense, you see…”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Well,” the Chair said, “it can come out of their department’s budget. That seems fair, and it will make our network more secure.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“And you expect those orders to go through in <em>one week</em>?” Derek asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You had <em>two</em> weeks to prepare,” Administrator #1 scolded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“And what about our faculty abroad? A lot of them don’t have a stable address, and I’m not going to be able to guarantee that they get their token within our timeline. Look, I agree, 2FA is definitely great for security- I’m a big advocate for our customers, but you can’t just say, <em>let’s do this</em> without actually having a plan in place! ‘It’s more secure’ isn’t a plan!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Well,” the Chair said, harrumphing their displeasure at Derek’s outburst. “That’s well and good, but you should have raised these objections sooner.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I’m raising these objections before the public announcement,” Derek said. “I only just found out about this last week.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Ah, yes, you see, about that… we made the public announcement right before this meeting.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You <strong>what</strong>?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Yes. We sent a broadcast email to all faculty, staff and students, announcing the new mandated 2FA, as well as a link to activate 2FA on their account. They just have to click the link, and 2FA will be enabled on their account.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Even if they have no way to received the token?” Derek asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Well, it does <em>ask</em> them if they have a way to receive a token…”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the time Derek got back to the helpdesk, the inbox was swamped with messages demanding to know what was going on, what this change meant, and half a dozen messages from professors who saw “mandatory” and “click this link” and followed instructions- leaving them unable to access their accounts because they didn’t have any way to get their 2FA token.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the next few days, the Technology Council tried to round up a circular firing squad to blame someone for the botched roll-out. For a beat, it looked like they were going to put Derek in the center of their sights, but it wasn’t just the Business School that saw a disaster with the 2FA rollout- <em>every</em> school in the university had similar issues, including the School of Sciences, which had been pushing the change in the first place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the end, the only roll-back strategy they had was to disable 2FA organization wide. Even the accounts which had 2FA previously had it disabled. Over the following months, the Technology Council changed its tone on 2FA from, “it makes our network more secure” to, “it just doesn’t work <em>here</em>.”</p>\r\n<!-- Easy Reader Version: And this is where, \"oh, it's great, but it doesn't work here\" comes from. --><div>\r\n\t<img src=\"//img.thedailywtf.com/images/inedo/buildmaster-icon.png\" style=\"display:block; float: left; margin: 0 10px 10px 0;\"/> [Advertisement] \r\n\t<a href=\"http://inedo.com/BuildMaster?utm_source=tdwtf&amp;utm_medium=footerad&amp;utm_term=Q12016&amp;utm_content=BM2&amp;utm_campaign=buildmaster\">Application Release Automation for DevOps</a> – integrating with best of breed development tools.

How do you enhance the likelihood of having successful ideation sessions? While producing new ideas might not be difficult considering how frequently ideas come and go, producing great ideas often requires some inspiration and implementing some scientifically proven techniques of ideation.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&rsquo;s time to let go of conventional, boring idea generation tactics. How about trying some innovative and fun ideation techniques to generate better solutions and ideas?</span></p><h2><b>Techniques That Encourage Ideation</b></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They can be structured and organized or be plain silly!</span></p><h3><b>1. Brainstorming</b></h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brainstorming is the most common and the most popular ideation technique in almost every industry. It&rsquo;s also one of the best ways to generate many ideas as a team than what you can achieve sitting and thinking alone. Brainstorming is all about the quantity of ideas and not the quality. The intention of a brainstorming session is to think collectively. Each individual in the group should tune up the generative part of their brain and tone down the evaluative part. They should engage with each other, listen, and build on ideas.</span><br/><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, freestyle brainstorming might not lead to substantial ideas. The linear brainstorming process at </span><a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3061059/how-to-brainstorm-like-a-googler\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> includes the following steps:</span></p><ol><li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Know the user</span></li><li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Think 10x</span></li><li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Prototype</span></li></ol><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To ensure that your brainstorming sessions are effective, follow these best practices:</span></p><ol><li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Set a time limit to the brainstorm mode. During this time, the only goal should be to come up with as many ideas as possible. Judging the ideas generated during this period is strictly prohibited.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Start the session with a problem statement, a plan, a goal, a point of view, or &ldquo;how can we&rdquo; questions. Whatever the topic is, stay focused on it. The father of brainstorming, </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Faickney_Osborn\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alex F. Osborn</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, emphasized the inefficiency of brainstorming sessions that address multiple questions. </span></li><li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Don&rsquo;t judge, evaluate, or criticize any idea even in the form of non-verbal actions. As the facilitator of the brainstorming session, you should set a positive tone that allows the participants to feel confident.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Encourage crazy, wacky, and even weird ideas.

Gamestorming</b></h3><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19415\" src=\"http://blog.hackerearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Ideation-1-1.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"313\" srcset=\"http://blog.hackerearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Ideation-1-1.jpeg 640w, http://blog.hackerearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Ideation-1-1-300x147.jpeg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\"/><img/></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: </span><a href=\"http://www.imagethink.net/game-storming-sxswi/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ImageThink</span></a></span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having a playful way to brainstorm often leads to a surge in creativity. Gamestorming is the combination of brainstorming and gamification. It involves a set of problem-solving and ideation methods that are gamified in just to increase the level of energy, engagement, and collaboration during brainstorming sessions. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some examples of gamestorming sessions include:</span></p><h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>1.</em><em><strong>Cover story</strong>:</em> This gamestorming involves the use of a template that makes the participants generate a cover story, including the main image, a headline, sidebars with relevant facts, quotes, etc. This is a great technique for vision generation sessions as it uses the primary characteristics of a broad subject to create a cohesive picture.</span></h4><h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>2. <strong>Fishbowl</strong>:</em> In this ideation session, participants are required to sit in two circles, where the larger one surrounds the smaller circle. Participants in one of the circles brainstorm while those in the other observe, listen, and take notes without saying anything. This gives everyone a chance to engage in the brainstorming session.</span></h4><h3><b>3. SCAMPER</b></h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This ideation technique is an acronym with each letter representing an action verb that prompts creative ideas. The letters stand for:</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>S</strong> &ndash; <strong>S</strong>ubstitute</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>C</strong> &ndash; <strong>C</strong>ombine</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>A</strong> &ndash; <strong>A</strong>dapt</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>M</strong> &ndash; <strong>M</strong>odify</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>P</strong> &ndash; <strong>P</strong>ut to another use</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>E</strong> &ndash; <strong>E</strong>liminate </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>R</strong> &ndash; <strong>R</strong>everse</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Developed by </span><a href=\"https://books.google.co.in/books/about/Scamper.html?id=0Gmx_jr64RMC&amp;redir_esc=y\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bob Eberle</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, SCAMPER is a checklist that uses action verbs as stimuli to come up with new ideas for making a new product or modifying an existing product.</span></p><h3><b>4. Questioning assumptions</b></h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conventional thoughts and assumptions often take up a lot of thought space in our head. Freeing yourself from these makes it easier to generate great ideas. Almost every industry has certain deep-rooted orthodox beliefs they follow. These unspoken principles act as blinders (like the ones horses wear) that don&rsquo;t allow one to see new possibilities and ideas. Bryan W. Mattimore, author of &nbsp;&ldquo;Idea Stormers: How to Lead and Inspire Creative Breakthroughs,&rdquo; outlines in his book the impact questioning assumptions has on ideation. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In his book, Mattimore tells the story of Gary Fraser, his colleague, who had to face larger and established competitors (Crest and Colgate) in the toothpaste industry after taking over the oral care business unit at Unilever. From a product standpoint, he couldn&rsquo;t compete with them. He also couldn&rsquo;t spend more than them in marketing. The solution was to question every aspect of the toothpaste business. And the result was Mentadent, the first and a very successful baking soda and peroxide toothpaste in the world.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To question assumptions in your industry, first generate a set of, say, 20 to 30, assumptions, They can be true or false. Pick some of these and use them as the trigger for new ideas. Do consider every aspect of your business while generating the assumptions, including consumer beliefs, product positioning, materials, manufacturing, distribution, and pricing.</span></p><h3><b>5. Mind mapping</b></h3><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19417\" src=\"http://blog.hackerearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Ideation-2.png\" alt=\"Mind mapping: Top 12 Ideation Techniques\" width=\"1136\" height=\"766\" srcset=\"http://blog.hackerearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Ideation-2.png 1136w, http://blog.hackerearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Ideation-2-300x202.png 300w, http://blog.hackerearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Ideation-2-768x518.png 768w, http://blog.hackerearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Ideation-2-1024x690.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1136px) 100vw, 1136px\"/><img/></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: </span><a href=\"https://www.mindmeister.com/blog/mind-maps-essay-writing/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MeisterLabs</span></a></span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a graphical technique that makes participants imagine connections between different sets of ideas or information. Mind mapping involves writing down each idea and then connecting each of them by lines or curves to facts or ideas related to them, thus creating a web of relationships. It was a UK researcher, Tony Buzan, who developed &ldquo;mind mapping&rdquo; and discussed it in his book &ldquo;Use your Head,&rdquo; published in 1972. This technique enables sharing of ideas and concepts by capturing attention and framing information.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To apply mind mapping to your brainstorming session, ask the participants to write a word or a key phrase in the center of the board/page. Then, ask them to write anything and everything that comes to their mind on the same page. Finally, ask them to make connections as explained earlier.</span></p><h3><b>6. Daydreaming</b></h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although daydreaming doesn&rsquo;t earn any approval from most thought leaders, it is one of the most important ways to generate new ideas. Take the airplane for example. If the Wright brothers hadn&rsquo;t had a wild imagination triggered by daydreaming about flying, transportation wouldn&rsquo;t have been as seamless as it is today. Daydreaming, most often, is a playful thought process that dwells on a person&rsquo;s creativity and ingenuity to work on a problem. It allows the person to develop an emotional connection with that problem, which triggers new ideas.</span></p><h3><b>7. Redefining opportunities</b></h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although deceptively simple, this technique is highly effective. And it sure removes the blinders you might not have realized you had on. In this technique, you have to first create a statement that defines your creative objective. This is your opportunity statement. In the next step, pick any three, preferably the most interesting, words in your opportunity statement and create creative alternatives for all of them using the 5Ws and H of your problem&mdash;who, what, when, where, why, and how. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Place your three lists in a table format, arranged in columns under the original words (placed at the top of each column). Finally, select one word randomly from each column and plug it into your original opportunity statement and create new variations of the statement to redefine your opportunity. These are crazy combinations, no doubt. And they&rsquo;re not necessarily the last stage of this idea generation technique. However, they are great triggers for new ideas as they allow you to see more possibilities than what you might have considered before.</span></p><h3><b>8. Wishful thinking</b></h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another ideation technique outlined by Mattimore, this technique seeks you to wish for the impossible and then find ways to make it possible with the help of brainstorming. Let your imagination go wild, but also ensure that your wishes are tangible. These wishes can be your creative stimuli to generate more realistic ideas. </span></p><h3><b>9. Brainwalking / Brainwriting</b></h3><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19418\" src=\"http://blog.hackerearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Ideation-3.png\" alt=\" Brainwalking / Brainwriting: Top 12 Ideation Techniques\" width=\"714\" height=\"1075\" srcset=\"http://blog.hackerearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Ideation-3.png 714w, http://blog.hackerearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Ideation-3-199x300.png 199w, http://blog.hackerearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Ideation-3-680x1024.png 680w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 714px) 100vw, 714px\"/><img/></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: </span><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Figure-4-Outcome-of-the-brainwriting-and-clustering-activities-part-2_279475246_fig4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Research Gate</span></a></span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a flexible technique that can also be applied to the other techniques. It gives everyone in your group an opportunity to contribute their thoughts and ideas. Brainwalking or brainwriting involves participants writing their ideas on one piece of paper among the several pieces that the facilitator places on a wall/whiteboard. They keep rotating, adding to their own thoughts or building upon their colleagues&rsquo; ideas. The group can also do this by sitting in a circle and passing the papers from one person to the other after brainstorming for a few minutes. The diversity of ideas this technique creates is phenomenal.</span></p><h3><b>10. Worst possible idea</b></h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A fun technique that gets the creative juices flowing, the worst possible idea was also introduced by Mattimore in his book. He exemplifies the technique with the help of a scenario where he was helping a group of bankers to generate innovative ideas. Even after hours of ideating, they couldn&rsquo;t come up with anything noteworthy. So as a last resort, Mattimore introduced asked them to list the worst possible ideas. This activity not only allowed the banker to have some fun but also led to positive ideation sessions in the future. Sometimes, it is better to go for the bad ideas than the good ones. This takes some pressure off the participants and allows them to be more adventurous and creative with their thoughts.</span></p><h3><b>11. Six thinking hats</b></h3><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19419\" src=\"http://blog.hackerearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Ideation-4.jpeg\" alt=\"Six thinking hats: Top 12 Ideation techniques\" width=\"2500\" height=\"2094\" srcset=\"http://blog.hackerearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Ideation-4.jpeg 2500w, http://blog.hackerearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Ideation-4-300x251.jpeg 300w, http://blog.hackerearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Ideation-4-768x643.jpeg 768w, http://blog.hackerearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Ideation-4-1024x858.jpeg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2500px) 100vw, 2500px\"/><img/></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: </span><a href=\"http://floridacsi.com/six-thinking-hats/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Florida Customer Service Institute</span></a></span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Developed by Edward de Bono, a psychologist, consultant, and author, this technique was pioneered by him in his book &ldquo;Six Thinking Hats,&rdquo; published in 1985. This technique allows participants in a group to put themselves in each other&rsquo;s shoes. Six Thinking Hats involves dividing ideas into six directions of thought:</span></p><ul><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>White hat:</strong></em> Data, facts, and information</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>Red hat:</strong></em> Emotions</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>Green hat:</strong></em> Ideas</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>Yellow hat:</strong></em> Positives</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>Black hat</strong></em>: Negatives or critical judgment</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>Blue hat:</strong></em> Control and overview</span></li></ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each hat in this technique signifies a distinct set of perspectives and priorities that will allow you to consider your project from a variety of angles. When you have a new problem, let each member in your group put on one of the hats. Companies that use the Six Thinking Hats technique for ideation in their day-to-day operations include Prudential Insurance, Siemens, Boeing, Honeywell, Motorola, Fidelity Investments, Eli Lilly, National Semiconductor, and many more.</span></p><h3><b>12. Creative pause</b></h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just as important as the other techniques of ideation is the creative pause, which de Bono spoke of in his book &ldquo;Serious Creativity.&rdquo; A creative pause gives you the time to pause, take a step back, and reflect and re-approach a problem with a fresh mind. It encourages proactive thinking rather than reactive thinking.</span></p><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you&rsquo;re finding ideation a challenge, brainstorming individually or in a group can get you out of the rut. Try any of these techniques to come up with great ideas and cultivate a creative approach to ideation.</span></p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://blog.hackerearth.com/top-12-ideation-techniques-to-brainstorm-new-ideas\">Top 12 ideation techniques to brainstorm your way to new ideas</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://blog.hackerearth.com\">HackerEarth Blog</a>.</p>"},"userId":"56d7cc3fccee17506699e735","feedId":"56d7de17c788cb1d6eb91b01","postId":"5a42297910906305c80012cd","updatedAt":"2017-12-26T10:50:33.942454104Z","title":"HackerEarth Blog","subscriptionId":"56d7de17c788cb1d6eb91b0c","tags":[]},{"read":true,"_id":"5a422b7010906305c80012e6-57e9fb18d5ec56510904cac2","createdAt":"2017-12-26T10:58:56.399494469Z","post":{"createdAt":"2017-12-26T10:58:56.372Z","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/7m715s/always_wanted_to_make_a_php_ide_out_of_vim_after/","date":"2017-12-26T10:10:33.000Z","guid":"t3_7m715s","author":"/u/phantaso0s","updatedAt":"2017-12-26T10:58:56.372Z","title":"Always wanted to make a PHP IDE out of Vim?

It was pretty vague and broad, without an actionable plan. I just had the intuition&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;the software configuration and tuning, especially after the adoption of microservices, was getting too complex.</p><h4 name=\"4305\" id=\"4305\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">The increasing complexity of configuring and tuning&nbsp;systems</h4><p name=\"b8e7\" id=\"b8e7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">If you have enough experience in the software industry, then it&rsquo;s very likely that you&rsquo;ve struggled with either a configuration problem or a tuning problem.</p><p name=\"a62d\" id=\"a62d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Configuration and tuning problems are pretty common and can lead to really bad outages. They often occur when:</p><ol class=\"postList\"><li name=\"3517\" id=\"3517\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">Some parts of the system are poorly or wrongly configured, or</li><li name=\"ba48\" id=\"ba48\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">A configuration that worked before now doesn&rsquo;t work because the context of the system has changed.</li></ol><p name=\"30d4\" id=\"30d4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">Think of a number of database replicas and their writing schemes. Or in Postgresql, think of the number of shared buffers, effective cache size, and the min and max wal size.</p><p name=\"c10e\" id=\"c10e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If wrongly configured from the start, it won&rsquo;t work in the given context, plain and simple. What&rsquo;s more interesting, though, is if it&rsquo;s <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">correctly</em> configured, it might work at a given time. But as the context changes&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;system workload, system resources usage, overall system architecture&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;the system will behave poorly. Or, even worse, an outage might happen.</p><p name=\"e482\" id=\"e482\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This will, inevitably, lead to manually-performed operations and the creation of heuristics. In other words, it will lead to:</p><blockquote name=\"91cf\" id=\"91cf\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\">Oh, we should set X to A, when workload is T, but it should be A+10 when workload is T+100 and we have system resources usage above 80%&hellip; I guess. Or maybe let&rsquo;s just up a queue in front of this component, queues solve everything, right?</blockquote><p name=\"200a\" id=\"200a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">Now multiply this scenario by tens or hundreds of services. Think for a second about the cognitive burden resulting from these configurations.</p><p name=\"dab3\" id=\"dab3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This is not a new concern. In 2003, Ganek and Corbi <a href=\"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5386835/?reload=true\" data-href=\"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5386835/?reload=true\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">discussed</a> the need for autonomic computing to handle the complexity of managing software systems. They noted that managing complex systems became too costly, labor-intensive, and prone to error due to the pressure engineers felt while maintaining them. This increased the potential of system outages with a concurrent impact on business.</p><p name=\"66f5\" id=\"66f5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Even nowadays, most of the configurations and tuning of the systems are performed manually, often in run-time, which is known to be a very time-consuming and risky practice.

So why not delegate these tasks to something that excels at exactly that? <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Machine learning sounds like a feasible tool for the job.</em></p><p name=\"262b\" id=\"262b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">After starting my Masters at the University of British Columbia, I kept working on this idea. It seemed interesting although quite weird, and, sometimes, unpractical and impossible to implement.</p><p name=\"5857\" id=\"5857\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">To my surprise, I realized I wasn&rsquo;t alone. Some very interesting people were working on these ideas&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;so it might not be that weird, unpractical, and impossible.</p><p name=\"d3b9\" id=\"d3b9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Recently, Jeff Dean&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;a man that I admire a lot&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15892956\" data-href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15892956\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">gave a talk at NIPS 2017 talking about machine learning for systems</a>, where he stated:</p><blockquote name=\"7f6e\" id=\"7f6e\" class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\">Learning should be used throughout our computing systems.

One of the engineers I admire the most was talking about the very same ideas I&rsquo;ve been thinking about and working on.</p><p name=\"d288\" id=\"d288\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This led me to think that it&rsquo;s not only interesting but <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">natural to think about enhancing software systems with machine learning.</strong> Throughout the whole software stack, we have many heuristics that, although they work well, could be improved by machine learning.</p><p name=\"5770\" id=\"5770\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Is it challenging and potentially risky? Yes, most definitely. Especially given that interpretability, apparently, has become a secondary goal in the machine learning community. How can we interpret and explain the decisions made by neural nets?</p><p name=\"31e3\" id=\"31e3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">However, with that said, these obstacles shouldn&rsquo;t hinder scientific and technological progress. <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.01208.pdf\" data-href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.01208.pdf\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Yes, we should question old paradigms </a>and try to improve things.</p><figure name=\"95d8\" id=\"95d8\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 251px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 35.8%;\"></div><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*puiL2EVDE6Ztlocw3JD1uQ.png\" data-width=\"779\" data-height=\"279\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*puiL2EVDE6Ztlocw3JD1uQ.png\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*puiL2EVDE6Ztlocw3JD1uQ.png\"/></div></figure><h4 name=\"1881\" id=\"1881\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure\">Towards machine learning-enhanced software&nbsp;systems</h4><p name=\"8643\" id=\"8643\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">As Jeff Dean pointed out: we need to find <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">practical</strong> ways to make systems data-aware. We need systems that collect metrics and metadata about themselves. To achieve this, we could learn a thing a two from the ideas in systems observability and instrumentation. We have been instrumenting systems for decades, and the data is already there.</p><p name=\"445a\" id=\"445a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">We also need to find <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">practical</strong> and <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">clean</strong> ways to <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">integrate</strong> machine learning components into software systems, making learning a first-class citizen in the system. This will lead to <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">systems that learn how to improve themselves,</strong> beating heuristics and manually-performed operations. Think about this for a second. It does sound cool <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">and</em> feasible.</p><p name=\"f2d1\" id=\"f2d1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I would also add that we need <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">practical</strong> and <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">clean</strong> ways to propagate the decisions made by the learned models to the rest of the system. This would allow the system to have self-adaptive capabilities. Here, we could learn something from the control theory community.</p><p name=\"751f\" id=\"751f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The general idea is fairly simple: make a system learn about its behavior by training a model on its context. Then allow it to change its structures and configurations in order to optimize for a certain scenario. Now implement this idea in such a way that it could be possible to integrate it into many kinds of systems.</p><h4 name=\"edb8\" id=\"edb8\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Summary</h4><p name=\"b5d6\" id=\"b5d6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">The most interesting questions I have in mind are:</p><ol class=\"postList\"><li name=\"06e6\" id=\"06e6\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">Can self-adaptation by learned models lead to more stable, faster, safer software systems? Can it reduce the need for manually configuring and tuning systems, allowing engineers to focus on more important tasks?</li><li name=\"c151\" id=\"c151\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Can this be easily integrated into software systems, requiring only small changes to the codebase?</li><li name=\"4428\" id=\"4428\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Can this work with low overhead?</li></ol><p name=\"e061\" id=\"e061\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">It is worth noting that this <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">would not</strong> replace good engineers, but would rather free the engineers&rsquo; cognitive abilities to focus on what matters.</p><p name=\"430a\" id=\"430a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\"><a href=\"http://www.sysml.cc/\" data-href=\"http://www.sysml.cc/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">I genuinely believe that this will become a trend in the next few years</a>.

Many have accumulated considerable amounts of money in the hundreds of thousands (or millions) of dollars.</em></p><p><em>So what&rsquo;s next? What do you do when you&rsquo;ve already done the basics of personal finance?</em></p><p><em>Alistair got the kind of behind-the-scenes access that few of us have. He spoke to wealthy people about their hopes, fears, and dreams around money &mdash; and discovered that once you&rsquo;re at a more advanced level, your concerns change. Your goals change. And whether you intended to or not, your lifestyle changes.</em></p><p><em>Let&rsquo;s see what he found.</em></p><p><em>Alistair, take it away&hellip;</em></p><p>_</p><p id=\"email\">Every week, Ramit gets thousands of emails with questions about personal finance.</p><p>99% of the time, his answer is the same: &ldquo;Go read my book, <em>I Will Teach You to be Rich.</em>&rdquo;</p><p>But 1% of the time, he gets a really interesting email that doesn&rsquo;t have a simple answer, and he&rsquo;ll forward it over to the IWT product team to see if we can help.</p><p>For example, check out this email a reader sent to Ramit after reading the IWT book:</p><blockquote><p><em>It&rsquo;s too beginner for me. I finished because of the entertaining style </em><em>and I like to vet books</em><em>&nbsp;before recommending them. My stage is this:</em></p><ol><li><em>Zero debt&hellip; pay credit cards to zero, twice a month. Paid off my mortgage 25 years early ($230k). Haven&rsquo;t paid a car loan in over 5 years. And my twins are now in school (so no more $1,500/mo child care any longer).</em></li><li><em>I&rsquo;m self-made with a video production/photography business + my wife is a psychologist with the VA, so we have a decent income. </em></li><li><em>We each have contributed $18k into our 401ks (mine is a solo-k) for years.</em></li><li><em>We have maxed our ROTHs for about 7 years each (more on this later).</em></li><li><em>We are very frugal (our two spending items are 1. quality food (groceries) and 2. travel).</em></li><li><em>I&rsquo;m about to turn 38, wife is 34.</em></li><li><em>We have $750k-$775k invested/saved and adding our house puts us over a million. </em></li></ol><p><em>WHAT NOW!?!</em></p></blockquote><p>At IWT, we love seeing emails&nbsp;like this. Here&rsquo;s someone who actually took action, implemented our personal finance advice, and is now in a great place with their finances.</p><p>From the outside in, there&rsquo;s absolutely nothing to worry about!&nbsp;And yet, we continue to get emails just like this from people worrying about their finances.</p><p>What&rsquo;s going on here? Why do we worry about money even though we&rsquo;re doing everything right?</p><h2>The psychology of why we worry about money</h2><p>In Ramit&rsquo;s book, he outlines what we call &ldquo;The Ladder of Personal Finance.&rdquo; People loved having a clear roadmap telling them exactly what to do next.</p><p><center><img style=\"border: solid 4px #ffffff; box-shadow: 0px 0px 3px 0px rgba(0,0,0,.15);\" src=\"https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/wp-content/uploads/pasted-image-0-421-e1513886719847.png\" class=\"wp-image-24049\" alt=\"pasted image 0 422\"/><em>&ldquo;The Ladder of Personal Finance&rdquo; from Ramit&rsquo;s book, </em>I Will Teach You To Be Rich</center></p><p>But eventually, you get to the end and there are no more rungs on the ladder. You&rsquo;ve checked all the boxes. All you&rsquo;re left with is that same empty feeling we had after finishing our favorite video game that we spent hours trying to master. Except&hellip; you don&rsquo;t have another game to play. With your finances, it can seem like the only thing left to do is sit and wait for the next 30 or 40 years until you retire.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know about you, but that sounds boring as hell.</p><p>I&rsquo;m impatient. I want to be optimizing, tweaking, and doing something to keep getting better every single day. If someone came to me tomorrow and said, &ldquo;OK Alistair, you&rsquo;ve checked all the boxes for your business. Now you just have to put it on autopilot and go sit on a beach for the next 30 years,&rdquo; <u><a href=\"https://growthlab.com/what-successful-people-dont-tell-you/\" target=\"_blank\">I&rsquo;d tell them they were crazy</a></u>.</p><p>Humans are problem-solving machines. We aren&rsquo;t good at sitting on our hands and being patient. For example, just <u><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVU6ANI059M\" target=\"_blank\">look at this video</a></u> of a woman in a self-driving car for the first time. Does she look relaxed? No! She is freaking out and worrying because she has nothing to do.</p><p>If money is supposed to buy us peace of mind, then why do some of us act just like this woman in the self-driving car? And what is the &ldquo;last mile&rdquo; that can get us to be more zen about our finances?&nbsp;</p><h2>3 things we noticed from people&nbsp;who don&rsquo;t worry about money</h2><p>As I mentioned above, I&rsquo;m on the product team here at IWT. We&rsquo;re in the course-making business, which means solving some gnarly problems for our readers. And this is the type of big question we LOVE to tackle to see if we can find interesting, counterintuitive solutions.</p><p>Over the past month, we&rsquo;ve been digging into the tactics and mindsets of the wealthy to find out what they do once they&rsquo;ve &ldquo;checked all the boxes&rdquo; and mastered the basics of personal finance.</p><p>How do they get to that enviable position where they never have to worry about money again? What do these carefree people know that we don&rsquo;t?</p><p>Today I&rsquo;d like to share three examples:</p><h3>1. They are prepared for everything</h3><p>Earlier this year, the <em>New Yorker</em>&nbsp;ran a fascinating article titled <u><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/01/30/doomsday-prep-for-the-super-rich\" target=\"_blank\">&ldquo;Doomsday Prep for the Super-Rich&rdquo;</a></u>. In the piece they described how some of the smartest, most successful people from Silicon Valley and Wall Street are preparing for the apocalypse&nbsp;(yes, you read that correctly).&nbsp;They are buying remote property, building self-sustaining bunkers, and sometimes even stockpiling ammunition to prepare for the eventual breakdown of civilization.</p><p>When asked the simple question of &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; here&rsquo;s what Yishan Wong, the former CEO of Reddit, told the <em>New Yorker</em>:</p><blockquote><p><em>Most people just assume improbable events don&rsquo;t happen, but technical people tend to view risk very mathematically &hellip; The tech preppers do not necessarily think a collapse is likely. They consider it a remote event, but one with a very severe downside, so, given how much money they have, spending a fraction of their net worth to hedge against this &hellip; is a logical thing to do.</em></p></blockquote><p>Maybe you&rsquo;re not ready to drop a few million on a bunker in rural Kansas, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t be prepared for the future.</p><p>In speaking to our students who worry about money, I&rsquo;ve noticed that a lot of people are afraid of unpredictable things that might happen in their future. Some people refer to these as &ldquo;the things you don&rsquo;t know that you don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; or &ldquo;unknown unknowns.&rdquo; Here&rsquo;s how one student described his fear:</p><blockquote><p><em>What worries me isn&rsquo;t job loss. What worries me is the million other things that could pop up. What&rsquo;s hiding around the corner that I don&rsquo;t know about?</em></p></blockquote><p>This type of fear can be incredibly powerful, because your imagination runs wild with worst-case scenarios. It&rsquo;s like when you are walking down the stairs into a pitch black basement of a rickety old house. It&rsquo;s terrifying. <em>Anything </em>could be lurking in those shadows.</p><p>But there&rsquo;s a simple solution: Turn on a light.</p><p>You can do the same thing with your finances. Instead of being afraid of &ldquo;unknown unknowns,&rdquo; you can shine a light on your financial future by learning from people ten years older than you who can tell you exactly what to expect.</p><p><u><a href=\"https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/already-handled-basics-save-money-get-ahead/\" target=\"_blank\">We call it the &ldquo;10 Year Savings Strategy&rdquo; and wrote about it here</a></u>.</p><h3>2. They protect the money they already have </h3><p>Ever see a news story about a rock star or athlete going bankrupt and wonder, &ldquo;How is it even possible to lose that much money?&rdquo;&nbsp;ESPN&rsquo;s documentary <em><u><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/30for30/film?page=broke\" target=\"_blank\">Broke</a></u></em>&nbsp;investigated the phenomenon of very rich athletes going completely broke. The statistics are shocking:</p><blockquote><p><em>According to a <u><a href=\"https://www.si.com/vault/2009/03/23/105789480/how-and-why-athletes-go-broke\" target=\"_blank\">2009 <em>Sports Illustrated article</em></a></u>, 60 percent of former NBA players are broke within five years of retirement. By the time they have been retired for two years, 78% of former NFL players have gone bankrupt or are under financial stress.</em></p></blockquote><p>One of the primary causes of financial problems for these athletes was not extravagant spending. It was mostly due to bad investments, ranging from real estate to restaurants to car washes. </p><p>It&rsquo;s an interesting cautionary tale because one of the most common questions I get from students who have &ldquo;mastered the basics&rdquo; of personal finance is &ldquo;How do I make my investments grow faster?&rdquo;</p><p>As your wealth grows, you&rsquo;ll find the investing opportunities start to grow as well. Instead of just a &ldquo;boring&rdquo; target date fund, now you can buy real estate, invest in start-ups, and take sizable positions in individual stocks. At a certain level,&nbsp;the world of hedge funds and private equity start to open up as well. It&rsquo;s tempting to throw your money at these exciting opportunities and promises of outsized returns&nbsp;and it&rsquo;s easy to&nbsp;develop&nbsp;an obsession with growth and moving faster.</p><p>I find this fascinating, because the research I&rsquo;ve done revealed that the most successful wealthy people have the <em>opposite</em>&nbsp;approach. Instead of asking&nbsp;&ldquo;what can I gain?&rdquo; their #1 question is &ldquo;how can I avoid losing money?&rdquo;</p><p>For example, Warren Buffett has <u><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0210/rules-that-warren-buffett-lives-by.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">two rules of investing</a></u>: </p><p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Rule 1: Never lose money.</em></p><p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Rule 2: Never forget rule 1.</em></p><p>So what does this mean for you?</p><p>This is more a matter of mastering your own psychology than any new tactic or fancy asset allocation. There&rsquo;s a reason at IWT we consistently recommend boring, simple investments like <u><a href=\"https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/lazy-portfolio/\" target=\"_blank\">lazy portfolios</a></u>&nbsp;and <u><a href=\"https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/asset-allocation-investor-psychology/\" target=\"_blank\">target date funds</a></u>.</p><p>But we&rsquo;ve also spent enough time studying the psychology of personal finance to know that being a 100% disciplined monk with your investments is near impossible. No matter how much you read about the merits of basic index investing and why stock picking never works, there&rsquo;s still a little voice in your head saying, &ldquo;Yeah, but what if I find the next Amazon stock? I&rsquo;d be a millionaire in five years!&rdquo;</p><p>Here&rsquo;s what we recommend: instead of suppressing that voice in your head, embrace it. Take 5% of your portfolio and put it aside for whatever crazy idea you have for making your money grow faster. Invest in Bitcoin. Buy $5,000 in Tesla stock. Invest in your cousin&rsquo;s car wash if you want.</p><p>Do whatever you want, because while you might lose that 5%, you can sleep well at night knowing 95% of your money is still safe and protected.</p><h3>3. They don&rsquo;t do it alone</h3><p>There&rsquo;s a great <u><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4P_vMXLhi2I\" target=\"_blank\">scene in <em>Entourage</em></a></u>&nbsp;where the agent Ari Gold is introducing the management team of actress and singer Mandy Moore. </p><p>(Heads up: You may want to put in headphones for that link, there&rsquo;s some NSFW language in that clip.)<em>&nbsp;</em></p><p>It&rsquo;s kind of eye-opening as he goes down the line introducing this super-team of six people who are required to manage the career of just one person: manager, music agent, publicist, attorney, music manager, theatrical agent, etc.</p><p>It&rsquo;s also possible to develop the same type of super-team to manage your finances and literally outsource your worry to someone else. Attorneys, accountants, life insurance specialists, financial planners, investment advisers, and even a psychologist or psychiatrist could all be part of your financial super-team.</p><p>You might be thinking, &ldquo;Wait, what? I thought Ramit hated financial advisors. Doesn&rsquo;t he spend an entire chapter in his book telling me NOT to hire a financial advisor. So what&rsquo;s going on here?&rdquo;</p><p>I asked Ramit about this incongruence, and he pointed out a really interesting and counterintuitive insight: Once you reach a certain point, the basic personal finance rules no longer apply.</p><p>Normal people with ordinary financial needs don&rsquo;t require an advisor. That&rsquo;s why we tell most people it&rsquo;s not worth their time. But once you&rsquo;ve conquered the basics, then the basic rules no longer apply.</p><p>Here are a few scenarios where it DOES make sense to pay an advisor:</p><ul><li>When you have a lot of investable assets (~$1MM+) and have much more to lose if you make a mistake.</li><li>If you have complex situations (imagine having three&nbsp;kids, planning for college, and buying a house at the exact same time).</li><li>When you just want a second set of eyes to make sure you have everything done right and aren&rsquo;t missing anything.</li><li>When you&rsquo;re short on time and want to pay for convenience (e.g., you can hire a bookkeeper who you forward bills to and who pays them for you).</li><li>When you run your own business, an accountant is a no-brainer who can &ldquo;cover your ass&rdquo; and also look out for things you don&rsquo;t know about.</li></ul><p>Is hiring an advisor expensive? Yes, of course. But ask yourself, how much is constantly worrying about your finances costing you?</p><p>If you&rsquo;re looking at getting help with your finances from a professional, then we&nbsp;recommend beginning your search at the National Association of Personal Finance Advisors (<u><a href=\"http://www.napfa.org\" target=\"_blank\">www.napfa.org</a></u>). These advisors are fee-based (they usually have an hourly rate), not commission-based, meaning that they want to help you, not profit off their recommendations.</p><p><center>***</center></p><p>If you read<em>&nbsp;I Will Teach You to be Rich,</em>&nbsp;applied everything, and you&rsquo;re now running into new, more advanced problems where there aren&rsquo;t clear answers&hellip; it can feel weird to bring stuff like that up to friends. &ldquo;Hi, do any of you know what to do after you max out your 401k and pay off your house? Thanks!&rdquo;</p><p>But here at IWT, you&rsquo;re with your fellow weirdos. It&rsquo;s safe, we promise. In the comments tell us how you&rsquo;ve &ldquo;leveled up&rdquo; and what you need help on next.

This would provide me with a fundamental understanding of chatbots.</li><li name=\"c352\" id=\"c352\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Success Outcome: Build a functional chatbot that did one thing well, iterate on real user feedback, and launch.</li></ul><p name=\"1d69\" id=\"1d69\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">Unlike past projects, I didn&rsquo;t have the exact idea in mind prior to making the decision to begin.</p><p name=\"deb9\" id=\"deb9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I had a window open on my laptop displaying a limited artist print I was looking at (<a href=\"https://artlife-gallery.myshopify.com/collections/alec-monopoly/products/alec-monopolys-pablo-judicial-diamonds-and-gold-serigraph-screenprint\" data-href=\"https://artlife-gallery.myshopify.com/collections/alec-monopoly/products/alec-monopolys-pablo-judicial-diamonds-and-gold-serigraph-screenprint\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Alec Monopoly&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pablo Judicial&rdquo;</a>). I simply typed &ldquo;art chatbot&rdquo; in Google to see if there was already a chatbot to purchase artwork.</p><p name=\"c20d\" id=\"c20d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">To my surprise, there was not. I knew that my passion for art was the perfect match for my weekend desire to master chatbots.</p><p name=\"5e92\" id=\"5e92\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I then removed the space in my search and had the name &ldquo;Art Chatbot&rdquo; in front of me. $9 and a few seconds later, and I also had the <a href=\"http://www.artchatbot.com\" data-href=\"http://www.artchatbot.com\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">domain</a>.</p><p name=\"c131\" id=\"c131\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Since it was still early Saturday morning and the above had taken place in the matter of about 30 minutes, I had an hour or so to create the logo (using <a href=\"https://logo.squarespace.com/\" data-href=\"https://logo.squarespace.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Squarespace logo creator</a>).</p><p name=\"8957\" id=\"8957\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I then worked on lean branding for social assets (<a href=\"http://snappa.io\" data-href=\"http://snappa.io\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Snappa</a>), and also created the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Art-Chatbot-127359754533703/\" data-href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Art-Chatbot-127359754533703/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook page</a> (which is required to build and test the bot since it is a Facebook Messenger Bot).</p><figure name=\"039f\" id=\"039f\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 390px; max-height: 362px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 92.80000000000001%;\"></div><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*SmZGCWKPumBbnH7km3fmMA.png\" data-width=\"390\" data-height=\"362\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*SmZGCWKPumBbnH7km3fmMA.png\"/></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Squarespace logo in minutes, and&nbsp;free!</figcaption></figure><p name=\"adb5\" id=\"adb5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Now that I had the logo, social cover, and also had the Facebook page live, I invited a few friends to like the page.</p><p name=\"d5a5\" id=\"d5a5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I got a few messages back asking what I was up to with the page and commenting on the name and logo. And so within minutes of my lean branding exercise, I already had some positive feedback!</p><p name=\"f6b7\" id=\"f6b7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I then told them what I was building and asked if they could test in the following hours over the course of my build.</p><p name=\"c4a8\" id=\"c4a8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This led to real user feedback as I was building so that I could create a more realistic conversational design and flow for my chatbot.</p><p name=\"003a\" id=\"003a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">After getting setup on <a href=\"http://www.chatfuel.com\" data-href=\"http://www.chatfuel.com\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Chatfuel</a>, I watched some YouTube tutorials and used some of the templates provided on Chatfuel to learn through modifying (thanks <a href=\"http://personabots.com/\" data-href=\"http://personabots.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Persona</a>!).</p><p name=\"6968\" id=\"6968\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I realized that the process is fairly straightforward, and it was all about the conversational flow and user journey.</p><h4 name=\"674f\" id=\"674f\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">I Then Completed the Following Definition Exercise to Define What I Was Going to&nbsp;Build:</h4><ol class=\"postList\"><li name=\"fb13\" id=\"fb13\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--h4\">Map out the conversational flow and user journey. In this case, it was for a user to discover artists, view artwork, and purchase artwork.</li><li name=\"f8b7\" id=\"f8b7\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Define the structure of the bot. In Chatfuel, this is done by &ldquo;blocks,&rdquo; which I created for each main state, sub states, destinations, queries, and answers.</li><li name=\"c5de\" id=\"c5de\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Identify and also limit the amount of content that I would display. Since I was building this in hours, it was more about the experience and validation, rather then how robust I thought it should be.</li></ol><p name=\"279d\" id=\"279d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">Actually building the bot in Chatfuel began at the second step with the blocks. It was mid-afternoon Saturday now and I was feeling a bit overwhelmed with the ambitious complexities I initially set out to build.</p><p name=\"d123\" id=\"d123\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">To overcome this, I removed some of the artists, the artwork to show, and then the artwork available so that I could focus on a better experience rather then trying to account for quantity.</p><figure name=\"7ba2\" id=\"7ba2\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 410px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 58.599999999999994%;\"></div><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*wK8vVRCRUs8wN2DLySIcnw.png\" data-width=\"2114\" data-height=\"1238\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*wK8vVRCRUs8wN2DLySIcnw.png\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*wK8vVRCRUs8wN2DLySIcnw.png\"/></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Art Chatbot being built from the Chatfuel dashboard.</figcaption></figure><p name=\"02f5\" id=\"02f5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Before Saturday was over, I had completed the initial version of Art Chatbot.

I was able to focus more on prepping for a launch along with continual chatbot iteration.</p><p name=\"18b5\" id=\"18b5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I also began implementing basic AI functionality into the bot. I messaged a few art technology companies to ask what data was valuable to them (knowing I could easily collect this). This way, I could be on their radar and possibly build a chatbot that had some monetary value through data down the road.</p><p name=\"c945\" id=\"c945\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I ended the day on Sunday by making a quick landing page using <a href=\"http://instapg.es/jHPw7\" data-href=\"http://instapg.es/jHPw7\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Instapage</a> and optimizing it for a Product Hunt launch that I would do Monday.</p><figure name=\"1d13\" id=\"1d13\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 506px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 72.3%;\"></div><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*CdleOwKip2abI7x4ob8xww.png\" data-width=\"1704\" data-height=\"1232\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*CdleOwKip2abI7x4ob8xww.png\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*CdleOwKip2abI7x4ob8xww.png\"/></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Created a <a href=\"http://www.artchatbot.com\" data-href=\"http://www.artchatbot.com\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">landing page</a> in a few minutes using Instapage and the content I used from the chatbot&nbsp;blocks.</figcaption></figure><p name=\"2646\" id=\"2646\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">To pre-launch the chatbot, I also setup <a href=\"http://botanalytics.co\" data-href=\"http://botanalytics.co\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Botanalytics</a> (to help monitor, track, and analyze messages), posted in <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/aichatbots/\" data-href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/aichatbots/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook Groups</a> to generate initial users, and then drafted my Product Hunt intro that I would post.</p><p name=\"7206\" id=\"7206\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I also used a Google doc to create all the verbiage I would share on my social channels. Then I could simply copy the text, add the Product Hunt URL, and share across channels on Monday.</p><p name=\"c2ce\" id=\"c2ce\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The result is that Art Chatbot hit 100 upvotes on <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/posts/art-chatbot\" data-href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/posts/art-chatbot\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Product Hunt</a> and had also sent over 1,800 messages by the end of the day.</p><p name=\"765e\" id=\"765e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I not only learned about chatbots, but I am more confident in my understanding of the technology through a real use case.

This figure had increased by 9% from the survey that was conducted in 2009. </span><a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/innovationsurvey/files/innovation_full_report.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PwC&rsquo;s Global Innovation Survey 2017</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> provides further evidence that innovation is high up on the agenda of most firms. Of the 246 CEOs surveyed from around the world, 64% responded that innovation and operational effectiveness were equally important to the success of their company.</span></p><h2><b>So, what do successful innovation officers have in common?</b></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The CINO role is multidisciplinary and requires a combination of traits that are hard to find in each other&rsquo;s company. While the CEO is responsible for directing overall company strategy and creating a vision for the future, the CINO is required to take charge of the vision by taking calculated risks and creating a space for new ideas and creativity. </span></p><blockquote><p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CINOs are not necessarily great innovators, however they can recognize potential innovation opportunities and galvanize company will and resources toward them.</span></i></p></blockquote><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19408\" src=\"http://blog.hackerearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/innovation-managers-1.jpeg\" alt=\"What do top innovation managers and chief innovation officers have in common\" width=\"906\" height=\"522\" srcset=\"http://blog.hackerearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/innovation-managers-1.jpeg 906w, http://blog.hackerearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/innovation-managers-1-300x173.jpeg 300w, http://blog.hackerearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/innovation-managers-1-768x442.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 906px) 100vw, 906px\"/><img/></p><h2><b>1. Excellent People Management Skills</b></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Top innovation managers understand that collaboration is key. Among the first tasks of the CINO is the need to bridge the gaps between various C-level executives and gain organization-wide buy-in. It is important to engage the senior executive leadership team effectively instead of simply aiming for nodding acquiescence.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The CINO is able to communicate the company&rsquo;s vision to various levels of people such that it becomes their own. He/she can build connections both within and outside the company to enable the gathering of insights and inspirations that are necessary for the innovation cycle. He/she can also employ design thinking and promote his/her technology team.</span></p><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mkbhatt/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manoj Kumar</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Head of Innovations, Tata Trusts, believes that </span></p><blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ldquo;innovation is the lifeline of any business and if you don&rsquo;t, someone else will disrupt you out from your market.&rdquo; </span></p></blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He adds, </span></p><blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ldquo;I expect innovation offices to become the in-house incubator and accelerator of innovative ideas and create a pipeline of new solutions that can catapult the business on a non-linear growth trajectory.&rdquo;</span></p></blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since innovation efforts are usually met with apprehension, CINOs are able to align their innovation strategy with the company&rsquo;s strategy and quickly provide tangible proof of concepts or prototypes. This helps boost collaboration and enables more manual tasks to be automated.</span></p><h2><b>2. Excellent Communication Skills</b></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the reasons why innovation strategies are met with resistance is the fear of job loss. CINOs are able to explain the concepts of artificial intelligence in simple and relatable terms to all levels of people. They describe how jobs will not be lost. Instead, the nature of laborious jobs will change to allow employees to focus their time and efforts on more value-added tasks. Being able to explain high-level technology terms in simple language is necessary to put people at ease and gain their trust. CINOs demonstrate the credibility and feasibility of their innovation efforts by releasing actual prototypes for the employees to try. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ideally, CINOs should be seasoned professionals with the experience of handling several senior executive leaders. </span></p><h2><b>3. Keen Business Understanding</b></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if the CINO has not worked as an entrepreneur or an &ldquo;intrapreneur,&rdquo; it is important for him/her to think like one. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Top CINOs have a sharp understanding of the culture they are working in, which helps them decide when to follow precedent and when to take a new path. It also helps them gain insights into how to get buy-in to implement an innovation effectively. According to </span><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/srikantgopal/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Srikant Gopal</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, former vice president of global innovation at Nestle Purina Petcare, </span></p><blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ldquo;The way I look at it is, we can get some of the key stakeholders on board and get enough of them to neutralize the hopefully small minority of naysayers. In a large company, that's probably the most realistic outcome.\"</span></p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/press/bios/katharina-borchert/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Katharina Borchert</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Chief Innovation Officer at Mozilla, says,</span></p><blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &ldquo;The CINO role often includes analyzing trends and identifying emerging new market opportunities that guide investment decisions.&rdquo;</span></p></blockquote><h2><b>4. Adequate Technological Understanding</b></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CINOs may be defined as enablers who design processes and introduce best practices that allow the creation of a space for others to develop and drive novel concepts. CINOs do not necessarily hail from technical backgrounds, but have sufficient knowledge to enable them to assimilate technical data and derive intelligent conclusions. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although most companies have separate teams dedicated to technology watching, trend analysis, and market analysis, these teams do not communicate with one another to share their findings. The CINO focuses on boosting collaboration between these teams to enable intelligence-driven innovation.</span></p><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Innovation involves an in-depth understanding of an organization&rsquo;s business, its customers, competitors, and usage of data. </span><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/chandrahas-panigrahi-4266119/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chandrahas Panigrahi</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Chief Marketing Officer and Business Director of Acer India, says, </span></p><blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ldquo;The CINO role involves more responsibility compared to the fancy designation; other key requisites include analytical skills, excellent interpersonal skills, strong business knowledge, inquisitive and creative mind to develop inventive strategies and direct new projects.&rdquo;</span></p></blockquote><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://blog.hackerearth.com/what-top-innovation-managers-common\">What do top innovation managers have in common</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://blog.hackerearth.com\">HackerEarth Blog</a>.</p>"},"userId":"56d7cc3fccee17506699e735","feedId":"56d7de17c788cb1d6eb91b01","postId":"5a42195110906305c800129f","updatedAt":"2017-12-26T09:41:38.021155513Z","title":"HackerEarth Blog","subscriptionId":"56d7de17c788cb1d6eb91b0c","tags":[]},{"read":false,"_id":"5a42092d10906305c8001247-56d7de17c788cb1d6eb91b0c","createdAt":"2017-12-26T08:32:45.748553492Z","post":{"summary":"<p>“The future of innovation is recognizing resource constraints as enabling, rather than inhibiting innovation,” says professor Martin Hoegl, Whu-Otto Beisheim School of Management.

RCI promises high customer benefit at a very low cost, thus making the product attractive and/or affordable for consumers with financial limitations. Ray and Ray identified three critical factors for RCI:</span></p><ul><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Entrepreneurial leadership and vision</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Modular designs to fulfill user demands of affordability, operability, and functionality through architectural innovation</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exploitation of the local knowledge base and creation of local innovation clusters</span></li></ul><h2><b>Ways to innovate with resource constraints</b></h2><p><a href=\"https://www.alexandria.unisg.ch/232147/1/ZeschkyWinterhalterGassmann_ISPIM2014_final.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zeschky, Winterhalter, and Gassmann (2014)</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> differentiated between four types of innovation methods that can be adopted when one has fewer financial resources&mdash;cost innovation, good-enough innovation, frugal innovation, and reverse innovation.</span></p><h3><b>Cost Innovation</b></h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cost innovation is not a new concept. It is applied through ongoing process improvements enabled using advantageous locations in low-cost countries. Cost innovations attract both poor and affluent consumers because they appeal to consumers seeking cost-efficiency as well as consumers with a limited budget. Williamson explored the term &ldquo;cost innovation&rdquo; in his 2010 paper &ldquo;</span><a href=\"http://www.businessmodelcommunity.com/fs/Root/8oex9-Williamson.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cost Innovation: Preparing for a &ldquo;Value-for-Money&rdquo; Revolution</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.&rdquo; The method aims to deliver an existing solution at a cheaper cost to first-time consumers or poorer consumers. It typically relies on the use of cost-effective raw materials, standard components and commodities, local production, and local sourcing. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An example of cost innovation is Huawei&rsquo;s ability to sell first-rate smartphones at a cost 20 percent less than Western companies. In 2009, Huawei was also able to beat Ericsson and win a 4G mobile network by providing the same quality and functionality at a lower cost. Similarly, Nokia, in 2006, was able to manufacture and sell a variety of low-cost mobile phones in China. </span></p><h3><b>Good-enough Innovation</b></h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like cost innovation, good-enough product innovation is not a completely new concept. It entails adapting or re-engineering an existing product to meet the specific requirements of customers with limited budgets. In short, good-enough innovation is equivalent to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cost innovation plus feature optimization</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Good-enough innovation also takes advantage of cost-effective raw materials, standard components and commodities, local production, and local sourcing. In addition, it relies on less automation, high robustness, high ease of use, and limitation to core features. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, </span><a href=\"https://www.mt.com/in/en/home.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mettler Toledo</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a Swiss laboratory equipment manufacturer, used the existing weighing scale present in Western markets to create a new, low-cost weighing scale suited to the needs of the Chinese market. The company used cheaper materials, simple design, and low-cost manufacturing, and retained only essential features to keep costs low. Similarly, Logitech created low-cost versions of its products for emerging markets by using low-cost materials, reducing packaging, and removing non-essential features.</span></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19402\" src=\"http://blog.hackerearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Cash-strapped-2.png\" alt=\"Types of innovation on a budget\" width=\"850\" height=\"389\" srcset=\"http://blog.hackerearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Cash-strapped-2.png 850w, http://blog.hackerearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Cash-strapped-2-300x137.png 300w, http://blog.hackerearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Cash-strapped-2-768x351.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px\"/><img/></p><h3><b>Frugal Innovation</b></h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frugal innovations are originally developed products, processes, or applications intended for consumers with low budgets. They are not re-engineered products like good-enough innovations, but have been created from scratch with new features that often disrupt the existing norm. Frugal innovation is also known by other terms such as &ldquo;jugaad&rdquo; or Gandhian innovation to emphasize the Indian context in which such innovations often take place. Frugal innovations are new from both a technological and a market perspective. They often employ an existing technology in a completely new way to access underserved markets.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GE&rsquo;s portable ultrasound device, </span><a href=\"http://www3.gehealthcare.com/en/products/categories/ultrasound/logiq\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Logiq Book</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, developed for rural areas in China in 2002, is a good example of frugal innovation. Although it had reduced functionality as compared to traditional ultrasound devices, its advantage was that doctors could carry it directly to their patients. This helped patients in rural areas access medical help without having to travel to hospitals in far-off places. Thus, GE helped bring ultrasound technology in previously unserved locations with a price reduction of nearly 80 percent. </span></p><h3><b>Reverse Innovation</b></h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the past, innovations would move from the established markets in the West to emerging markets in the East. However, with the rise of global innovation, products are being developed for both established markets as well as emerging markets. Reverse innovation occurs when cost, good-enough, and frugal innovation products are adopted in emerging markets first and then sold in other emerging markets and established markets. Reverse innovations are sometimes called </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">trickle-up</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> innovations as well.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GE&rsquo;s Logiq Book is an example of reverse innovation as well. After its introduction in Chinese rural markets, an advanced version of the product has been developed for Europe and the United States, where new applications have been discovered. Currently, this advanced version is being used in operating rooms and emergency rooms where stationary ultrasound machines do not fit, or in ambulances which use the machine directly at the accident site. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Innovating with minimal resources has become a global phenomenon now, with tools and technologies such as cloud computing, social media, and crowdfunding, smartphones, and 3D printing empowering people to do more with limited budgets. </span></p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://blog.hackerearth.com/how-to-innovate-when-cash-strapped\">How to innovate when you are cash-strapped</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://blog.hackerearth.com\">HackerEarth Blog</a>.</p>"},"userId":"56d7cc3fccee17506699e735","feedId":"56d7de17c788cb1d6eb91b01","postId":"5a42092d10906305c8001247","updatedAt":"2017-12-26T08:32:45.748551132Z","title":"HackerEarth Blog","subscriptionId":"56d7de17c788cb1d6eb91b0c","tags":[]},{"read":false,"_id":"5a420af310906305c8001287-57e9faf5d5ec56510904caa6","createdAt":"2017-12-26T08:40:19.928232811Z","post":{"createdAt":"2017-12-26T08:40:19.896Z","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/7m6nwo/file_orgcapture_item_under_existing_heading_if_it/","date":"2017-12-26T08:18:29.000Z","guid":"t3_7m6nwo","author":"/u/infinitieth","updatedAt":"2017-12-26T08:40:19.896Z","title":"file org-capture item under existing heading if it exists","description":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>This is a repost of a <a href=\"https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/18313/file-org-capture-item-under-existing-heading-if-it-exists/18319\">question from emacs stack exchange</a>.</p><p>I am not the original poster, but I encountered the same problem.

Not only in the past but even today a big proportion of employers (</span><a href=\"https://www.tlnt.com/hiring-job-hoppers-10-reasons-why-they-are-so-very-valuable/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">43%</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) support that they would not consider a job-hopper for their open positions.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For all those who are not familiar with the term, job-hopping is used to describe employees who change job positions every few years. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Millennials change positions for several reasons; what most of the recruiters believe is that they change positions because they are impatient, disloyal and selfish. But, looking at it from a different perspective they may actually be super talented people who are not challenged enough at their current position and are looking for new opportunities which will help them to develop their skills and knowledge. In addition to that, things have changed and the economy is not what it used to be. If our parents&rsquo; generation used to graduate, find a job at a company and then stick to this position for the &ldquo;rest of&rdquo; their career, today, our generation loves to try new experiences and enter new challenges. We have more opportunities and we have completely different preferences than their generation. Despite that, according to </span><a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3055035/you-should-plan-on-switching-jobs-every-three-years-for-the-rest-of-your-\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FastCompany</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, &ldquo;employees who stay with a company longer than two years are said to get paid 50% less&rdquo;. Therefore, millennials have also many other reasons to look for new opportunities more often.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Luckily, the proportion of 43% of the hiring managers and recruiters who still would not consider a job-hopper, in the past used to be even higher. Thus, while time goes and things changes, their opinion changes as well. Nowadays, recruiters focus more on the benefits of hiring a job-hopper may have, instead of focusing on prejudices about their reasons to change job positions.</span></p><ul><li><h2><b>Job-hoppers Are Easily Adaptive</b></h2></li></ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the fact that this category of people changes positions several times every few years, they are expected to be easily adaptive to the new working environment and to the new strategies that the new team needs to follow. They are also likely to be on-boarded quickly. Thus, less time, effort and money on integrating them to the company culture will be required due to the fact that those people have already been changing environments many times and are used to adapt to different organizational cultures.</span></p><ul><li><h2><b>They Are Risk-takers</b></h2></li></ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taking the risk to change positions every few years says a lot! These people are not afraid of trying new things and entering new challenges. They hate staying in the same place for too long and avoid secure roles for eight or ten years. Job-hoppers like jumping into new roles instead. Taking on new responsibilities and swimming to unknown waters is something they enjoy. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Myself, I would prefer to hire someone who loves trying new things and is not afraid of the risks it may have, rather than hiring someone who chases secure roles and is afraid of moving out of his/her zone. The first ones are the people who innovate and bring on the table </span><a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/12/what-is-disruptive-innovation\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">disruptive ideas</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which may shake up the industry, in the future or now.</span></p><ul><li><h2><b>Job-Hoppers Have A Higher Learning Curve And Score Higher Performance</b></h2></li></ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The reason we say that job-hoppers have a higher learning curve is that they are often placed outside of their comfort zone. Being job-hoppers they know that they have to make a great impression and to learn a lot as fast as possible, thus, improving the </span><a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3055035/you-should-plan-on-switching-jobs-every-three-years-for-the-rest-of-your-\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bottom line</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as well. Before moving to their next position they need to convince their current team and employer that they were worth hiring, but at the same time, they put efforts on performing as high as possible aiming to reach positive and valuable records in order to be able to &ldquo;sell&rdquo; their profile to their next employer. As a result, job-hoppers are often over-performers who learn a lot within a very short period of time.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to </span><a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3055035/you-should-plan-on-switching-jobs-every-three-years-for-the-rest-of-your-\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Penelope Trunk</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a serial entrepreneur, and author, the learning curve tends to flatten after three years. Therefore, job-hoppers who are believed to be with the same employer for two or three years, are within the timeline in which they can learn as much as possible and over-perform their goals. They are an opportunity for a company and they can be a great asset.</span></p><ul><li><h2><b>They Bring Knowledge From Your Competitors</b></h2></li></ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A bit more than the half of employers (</span><a href=\"https://www.tlnt.com/hiring-job-hoppers-10-reasons-why-they-are-so-very-valuable/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">53%</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) state that job-hoppers &ldquo;have a wide range of expertise&rdquo;! The truth is that when a job-hopper joins your company, he/she also brings advanced knowledge, best skill and practices, and experience from different companies he/she has been working for. Thus, if they used to work for a company in the same industry as yours, they will bring with them industry knowledge regarding processes or trends you should follow. On the other hand, if they come from a different industry, they can bring knowledge on new practices that could be adapted in your industry. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both scenarios could only have a positive impact on company&rsquo;s performance. They will either help you follow the industry, or they will help you be innovative and introduce new practices and processes into the industry.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All four aforementioned points about job-hoppers, tell us that we should change the way we see millennials who switch jobs very often. We should stop judging them with regards to this action, and instead start focusing on what they could bring to the company. They can be an important asset to the company by bringing new knowledge on processes and practices, by bringing disruptive ideas, and by bringing a bigger network from different companies (within or outside the industry).</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, it is not something easy to accept that after few years these people will be looking for a new company to join. All onboarding and training cost go &ldquo;wasted&rdquo; and this also comes along with other risks such as sharing all knowledge, skills and practices learned in your company, with other companies (and maybe with your competitors as well). But, this is something that sooner or later will happen anyways. There is a moment in life when people feel the need to make a change in their life and/or career. Therefore, considering and evaluating all advantages and disadvantages of hiring a job-hopper, it seems to be beneficial for a company to have someone who changes roles very often. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To avoid thinking in the same way we used to think a few years ago when recruiting, we should focus more on the skills someone can bring on the table, as well as on personality and how this person would fit with the company culture. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From a different point of view, someone could also say that switching positions every few years shows a lot about the personality and could be related to their unstable behavior or to their inability to decide what they really like. But, as stated above, along with this disadvantage, hiring a job-hopper comes with a lot of advantages as well. Therefore, I believe that these advantages and disadvantages should be evaluated in each specific situation, and only after considering each specific case, a decision should be made about hiring or not a job-hopper. Important is to be open-minded and to not make </span><a href=\"http://blog.hackerearth.com/types-bias-avoid-recruitment-process\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bias</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> decisions while screening a Resume. &ldquo;Going blind&rdquo; during the first screening is an option, and using a </span><a href=\"http://blog.hackerearth.com/five-reasons-use-talent-assessment-tool\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">talent assessment tool</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> before interviewing someone is another option.

Rounding out the top five industries are:</span></p><ul><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Information Technology &ndash; 42 percent</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leisure &amp; Hospitality &ndash; 41 percent</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transportation &ndash; 37 percent</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Retail &ndash; 36 percent</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manufacturing &ndash; 32 percent</span></li></ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*The study shows that a significant number of employers (43 percent) will not consider a candidate who has had short tenures with several employers. However, others point to advantages in hiring people who have worked for numerous companies. More than half (53 percent) of employers said job-hoppers tend to have a wide range of expertise and can adapt quickly (51 percent).</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The majority of employers (55 percent) said that they have hired someone they would categorize as a job-hopper. Of those employers:</span></p><ul><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">34 percent said the job-hopper left after a short period of time</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">40 percent said the job-hopper stayed for at least two years</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">17 percent said the job-hopper stayed for at least three years</span></li></ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To conclude, the way we perceive job-hoppers has changed over years and recruiters are not being anymore very strict. Recruiters are being open-minded and they are turning their focus toward the many positive things a job-hopper could bring to a company. To make the decision about hiring a job-hopper even easier, recruiters make use of technology as well. They use <a href=\"https://www.hackerearth.com/recruit/pricing/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=hop\">assessment tools </a>and focus more on practical results by testing a candidate on job-related tasks, instead of solely focusing on their resume.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">Hire &amp; assess your remote candidate effectively, with HackerEarth Recruit</p><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a style=\"font-size: 16px; color: #fff; padding: 10px 20px; border-radius: 3px; display: inline-block; text-decoration: none; background-color: #0099ff;\" href=\"https://www.hackerearth.com/recruit/pricing/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=hop\">Take A FREE trial</a></div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://blog.hackerearth.com/job-hopping-millennials-hoppers-better-hire\">Job-hopping makes millennials better hires</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://blog.hackerearth.com\">HackerEarth Blog</a>.</p>"},"userId":"56d7cc3fccee17506699e735","feedId":"56d7de17c788cb1d6eb91b01","postId":"5a42092d10906305c8001248","updatedAt":"2017-12-26T08:32:45.748569892Z","title":"HackerEarth Blog","subscriptionId":"56d7de17c788cb1d6eb91b0c","tags":[]},{"read":false,"_id":"5a41facd10906305c800122f-57e9f803d5ec56510904c9f4","createdAt":"2017-12-26T07:31:25.773135594Z","post":{"createdAt":"2017-12-26T07:31:25.747Z","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/7m6chy/updating_package_index_hackage_taking_forever_and/","date":"2017-12-26T06:51:33.000Z","guid":"t3_7m6chy","author":"/u/Tysonzero","updatedAt":"2017-12-26T07:31:25.747Z","title":"Updating package index Hackage taking forever and not showing any progress","description":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I updated <code>stack</code> recently, and now whenever I try to build anything it gives me:</p><pre><code>Updating package index Hackage (mirrored at https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackage.fpcomplete.com/) ... </code></pre><p>And stalls on that for hours.</p><p>My internet at the moment isn't all that fast, but this is still getting ridiculous, at least some sort of progress bar would be nice.</p><p>Is it supposed to take this long or is something wrong, and is there any way to speed the process alone.</p><p>I think I'm most likely going to switch from <code>stack</code> back to <code>cabal</code>, as alongside this issue the workflow for GHCJS and <code>stack</code> is far from optimal.

The need arises because we need to manipulate these constraints manually, store their evidence in data structures, etc.</p><p>For constraints that don't ship with a dedicated data type to represent them, there's the <code>Dict</code> wrapper from the <code>constraints</code> package to achieve the same. One issue with it is that it creates a boxed value, so <code>Dict (C a)</code> is one more pointer indirection than a dictionary for <code>C a</code> itself.</p><p>(2) Right now there is no way to treat data types as constraints. We have the <code>reflection</code> library that gives us two styles to achieve it:</p><ul><li><code>Given</code> for incoherent (unsafe) reflection</li><li><code>Reifies</code> for regular reflection</li></ul><p>The implementations of <code>Given</code> and <code>Reifies</code> rely crucially on <code>unsafeCoerce</code>, and two assumptions:</p><ul><li>classes with a single method are represented as newtypes in Core</li><li><code>=></code> and <code>-></code> are the same in Core</li></ul><p>There is a <a href=\"https://github.com/treeowl/ghc-proposals/blob/magic-reflection/proposals/0000-magic-reflection.rst\">proposal</a> to make GHC support reflection natively, but in its current form it requires a questionable use of <code>Symbol</code> to generate a data family constructor in a <code>deriving</code> declaration (this would be the first precedent where <code>deriving</code> takes up namespace).</p><p>We also have a similar situation for singleton types, because it is desirable to pass them implicitly:</p><ul><li><code>TypeRep</code> is passed via <code>Typeable</code></li><li><code>Sing</code> is passed via <code>SingI</code></li></ul><p>(3) The interactions between <code>Type</code> and <code>Constraint</code> are awkward as hell. They are the same in Core, but not in surface Haskell (more context in <a href=\"https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/11715\">Trac #11715</a> and the GHC <a href=\"https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/rae/constraint-vs-type/proposals/0000-constraint-vs-type.rst\">proposal</a>). Additionally, we have <code>()</code> and <code>(,)</code> that belong to both kinds (sort of, there's TDNR at play here) but are not kind-polymorphic, and <code>(,)</code> cannot be partially applied in constraints (more info in <a href=\"https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/UnliftedDataTypes#ProposalB2.Morelevitypolymorphism\">GHC wiki</a>, see <code>Constraintiness</code>).</p><p>(4) Classes largely overlap with records in functionality. We know that it's possible to encode any type class as a record and pass it explicitly (see <a href=\"http://www.haskellforall.com/2012/05/scrap-your-type-classes.html\">Scrap your type classes </a>). The reason we don't do this is because type class dictionaries are (a) guaranteed to be coherent (unless we use orphans or <code>-XIncoherentInstances</code>) and (b) are passed implicitly, which is convenient, especially when it comes to accessing superclasses.</p><p>(5) Creating synonyms for classes is painful. We have to write the following code:</p><pre><code>type Alias' a b c = (Foo a, Bar b, Baz, Quux, Tux c) class Alias' a b c => Alias a b c instance Alias' a b c => Alias a b c </code></pre><p>We cannot use the constraint synonym directly because it cannot be partially applied, and for a good reason: we want aliases to be nominally different to allow partial application. For types of kind <code>*</code> we have both <code>type</code> and <code>newtype</code>, but for constraints we have only <code>type</code> (and we have to simulate <code>newtype</code> with the trick above).</p><hr/><hr/><p>The above issues are interconnected. We have two similar features &mdash; classes and record types. But each has its downsides:</p><ul><li>data types: no control over coherence/implicit passing, no associated type families or functional dependencies</li><li>classes: no ability to manipulate the dictionary (construct it, pass it around) or even refer to its name, no newtypes</li></ul><p>I think that we should zoom out, take a look at all of these issues at once, and design a solution that would unify classes and data types in a new notion that would support fine-grained control over coherence and implicit passing. The ideal outcome of this thread would be a GHC proposal to address all of these shortcomings.</p></div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/int_index\"> /u/int_index </a><br/><span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/7m4oz6/haskell_needs_a_better_story_for_constraints/\">[link]</a></span><span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/7m4oz6/haskell_needs_a_better_story_for_constraints/\">[comments]</a></span>"},"userId":"56d7cc3fccee17506699e735","feedId":"57e9f802d5ec56510904c9d9","postId":"5a41a9b710906305c8001124","updatedAt":"2017-12-26T01:45:28.001727125Z","title":"Haskell  Reddit","subscriptionId":"57e9f803d5ec56510904c9f4","tags":["haskell","reddit"]},{"read":false,"_id":"5a41a9b710906305c8001125-57e9f803d5ec56510904c9f4","createdAt":"2017-12-26T01:45:28.001746364Z","post":{"createdAt":"2017-12-26T01:45:27.969Z","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/7m4or0/complete_haskell_professional_tips_secrets_book/","date":"2017-12-26T00:49:41.000Z","guid":"t3_7m4or0","author":"/u/brogrammer2018","updatedAt":"2017-12-26T01:45:27.969Z","title":"Complete Haskell Professional Tips & Secrets Book","description":"  submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/brogrammer2018\"> /u/brogrammer2018 </a><br/><span><a href=\"http://books.goalkicker.com/HaskellBook/\">[link]</a></span><span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/7m4or0/complete_haskell_professional_tips_secrets_book/\">[comments]</a></span>"},"userId":"56d7cc3fccee17506699e735","feedId":"57e9f802d5ec56510904c9d9","postId":"5a41a9b710906305c8001125","updatedAt":"2017-12-26T01:45:28.001745044Z","title":"Haskell  Reddit","subscriptionId":"57e9f803d5ec56510904c9f4","tags":["haskell","reddit"]},{"read":false,"_id":"5a41997c10906305c80010d0-57e9f803d5ec56510904c9f4","createdAt":"2017-12-26T00:36:12.893020495Z","post":{"createdAt":"2017-12-26T00:36:12.873Z","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/7m4jb7/todays_exercise_try_to_predict_ghcis_output_when/","date":"2017-12-26T00:18:03.000Z","guid":"t3_7m4jb7","author":"/u/haskellgr8","updatedAt":"2017-12-26T00:36:12.873Z","title":"Today's exercise: Try to predict GHCi's output when you type in `\"a\"`, `show \"a\"`, and `show . show $ \"a\"`","description":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Enjoy :)</p><p>Please don't post the answers here.</p></div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/haskellgr8\"> /u/haskellgr8 </a><br/><span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/7m4jb7/todays_exercise_try_to_predict_ghcis_output_when/\">[link]</a></span><span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/7m4jb7/todays_exercise_try_to_predict_ghcis_output_when/\">[comments]</a></span>"},"userId":"56d7cc3fccee17506699e735","feedId":"57e9f802d5ec56510904c9d9","postId":"5a41997c10906305c80010d0","updatedAt":"2017-12-26T00:36:12.893018575Z","title":"Haskell  Reddit","subscriptionId":"57e9f803d5ec56510904c9f4","tags":["haskell","reddit"]},{"read":false,"_id":"5a41896210906305c800107c-5814c43709a64c359672dd7a","createdAt":"2017-12-25T23:27:30.558146194Z","post":{"createdAt":"2017-12-25T23:27:30.536Z","inlineStatus":{"readStatusError":null,"readStatus":"success"},"link":"https://medium.freecodecamp.org/hackathon-report-what-can-you-code-in-30-hours-quite-a-lot-ffd7224c9745?source=rss----336d898217ee---4","date":"2017-12-25T23:06:33.000Z","guid":"https://medium.com/p/ffd7224c9745","author":"Ajay NS","updatedAt":"2017-12-25T23:27:30.536Z","title":"Hackathon Report: What can you code in 30 hours?

As a group of second year college students with a growing portfolio of work, my team and I wanted to find out. So we signed up to a hackathon.</p><p name=\"9912\" id=\"9912\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It was a Financial Technology (or &lsquo;Fintech&rsquo;)<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\"></em>hackathon organized by DCB Bank in the city of Mumbai. Although we were clueless about Fintech, we wanted to give it a try, in the hope of coming with an idea that solves a general problem.</p><p name=\"cdd3\" id=\"cdd3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The event was hosted in the beautiful and cozy co-working space by <a href=\"http://www.91springboard.com/\" data-href=\"http://www.91springboard.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">91 Springboard</a>.

With messaging apps gaining popularity, users prefer to access everything under one app. They are also in favor of one-on-one communication.</p><p name=\"451e\" id=\"451e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Gone are the days of emails, it&rsquo;s all about real-time chat now. With today&rsquo;s technology, it&rsquo;s possible to create a chat-bot which can learn by itself and automate most of the tasks, allowing mass communication on an individual level.</p><p name=\"65aa\" id=\"65aa\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">See <a href=\"https://medium.com/the-mission/11-best-uses-of-chatbots-right-now-1c27764b7e62\" data-href=\"https://medium.com/the-mission/11-best-uses-of-chatbots-right-now-1c27764b7e62\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\">here for a list</a> of some of the<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"></strong>best uses of chatbots right now<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">.</strong></p><h3 name=\"07f8\" id=\"07f8\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h3-strong\">What exactly did we&nbsp;build?</strong></h3><p name=\"9635\" id=\"9635\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">As we were at a Fintech hackathon, we thought about a bot that carries out all the functions that can be carried out by the bank&rsquo;s app and more&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;through chat.</p><p name=\"cc58\" id=\"cc58\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Once logged in, you can ask the bot for your balance, your last few transactions, and also to carry out actions such as fund transfers.

We picked this because my teammates were very familiar with it, and I was focusing on wrapping up APIs and UI primarily. But this stack was totally new to me, as I&rsquo;ve always worked on JavaScript or Python stacks. I wrote about my learning journey <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/ruby-on-rails-and-full-stack-javascript-ecadf631707\" data-href=\"https://hackernoon.com/ruby-on-rails-and-full-stack-javascript-ecadf631707\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p><p name=\"377d\" id=\"377d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It uses a basic PostgreSQL database to store user messages, and uses ActionCable for live data-streaming as required. The whole site (along with the chat as a widget) is built over the Materialize framework.</p><p name=\"e18a\" id=\"e18a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">One of the key features we planned to use was a customized AI, rather than going for something like IBM Watson or api.ai. This was wrapped into an API using Flask.</p><figure name=\"9662\" id=\"9662\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 236px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 33.7%;\"></div><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*vujT5aZnb1ynwVgpM8lqug.png\" data-width=\"769\" data-height=\"259\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*vujT5aZnb1ynwVgpM8lqug.png\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*vujT5aZnb1ynwVgpM8lqug.png\"/></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Intent mapping</figcaption></figure><p name=\"73c7\" id=\"73c7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Initially, when the bot has little to no training data, human assistance is required to give responses and also classify the intent of each user query for the bot to learn. Once it accumulates data, it can automate the whole process, giving appropriate responses.</p><p name=\"c3c0\" id=\"c3c0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">A few of the scripts used for the AI are available <a href=\"https://github.com/dhanushkamath/DCBHackathonScripts\" data-href=\"https://github.com/dhanushkamath/DCBHackathonScripts\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p><h3 name=\"43e7\" id=\"43e7\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">The Hackathon</h3><p name=\"27f9\" id=\"27f9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">We managed four hours of sleep over a span of more than 30 hours, while pushing over 50,000 lines of code to production.</p><p name=\"18bf\" id=\"18bf\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But it wasn&rsquo;t as bad as it sounds! The place itself has this motivating vibe, and there are mentors helping you out. There were breaks in between to chill with other teams and getting to know other kick-ass developers.</p><p name=\"2c43\" id=\"2c43\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">While my team mates focused on the Machine Learning part and the actual chat application on Rails, I worked on the UI for the service. This included an admin panel as well as the chat widget. Quite a lot of time was spent wrapping up the AI code into RESTful APIs and fixing bugs in the main code as well.</p><p name=\"cc21\" id=\"cc21\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In the end, what we had was a basic alpha version of the app we set out to build.</p><figure name=\"2575\" id=\"2575\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 1244px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 177.8%;\"></div><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*zjjvbbFaAJjb3CyLMD8cSA.jpeg\" data-width=\"720\" data-height=\"1280\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*zjjvbbFaAJjb3CyLMD8cSA.jpeg\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*zjjvbbFaAJjb3CyLMD8cSA.jpeg\"/></div></figure><h3 name=\"f6e4\" id=\"f6e4\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure\">The Experience</h3><blockquote name=\"e302\" id=\"e302\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--h3\">For a start, this was the most productive 30 hours of my life.</blockquote><p name=\"82f5\" id=\"82f5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">With constant bursts of motivation (and caffeine) driving me, there was no time for sitting around or lazing.
